{"title": "Meet Randi Burgenthal", "body": "I\u00a0am a native\u00a0Baltimorean, but\u00a0I\u00a0didn\u2019t grow up\u00a0in Pikesville or Randallstown,\u00a0or\u00a0the areas\u00a0that most of you think of when\u00a0my peers\u00a0say they grew up\u00a0in\u00a0Baltimore.\u00a0\u00a0I am not\u00a0really good\u00a0at the\u00a0high\u00a0school Jewish geography game, because I was one of\u00a0three\u00a0Jews in my high school\u00a0graduating class;\u00a0I guarantee you that you did\u00a0not know me\u00a0in\u00a0high\u00a0school.\u00a0\u00a0My family\u00a0did not\u00a0belong to\u00a0a\u00a0synagogue, so\u00a0I\u00a0am not good at that Jewish geography game either.I\u00a0grew up in Reisterstown\u00a0when\u00a0795\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0exist. There were\u00a0hardly any\u00a0restaurants or shops\u00a0or even a movie theater.\u00a0I remember my grandfather, my\u00a0, worrying because my parents were moving\u00a0to\u00a0as he called it, \u201cKlan Country.\u201dThe year was 1978, and\u00a0my\u00a0parents\u00a0decided to move\u00a0to Reisterstown\u00a0because they\u00a0heard that The Associated\u00a0had bought a plot of land and was planning on building a\u00a0JCC in\u00a0Owings Mills. The JCC,\u00a0my parents told me, would be a good place for\u00a0me and my\u00a0brother to grow up.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0my\u00a0parents, and\u00a0many\u00a0other families like mine,\u00a0moved to Reisterstown and\u00a0joined the new Owings Mills JCC.It wasn\u2019t easy growing up\u00a0in Reisterstown.\u00a0I was called\u00a0antisemitic\u00a0slurs\u00a0and was given\u00a0zeros on tests\u00a0that\u00a0were given on the high holidays\u00a0because\u00a0I wasn\u2019t at school.\u00a0I even remember one of my teachers telling me that I had to choose between being a good Jew or being a good student.In\u00a0third grade, a classmate called me Jew\u00a0Bagel.\u00a0I went home and cried to my parents. But\u00a0they did not switch me to a new school, call the principal, the board\u2014all things that I think we would do today. Instead,\u00a0my mother\u00a0looked at me and simply stated,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll go to the JCC,\u00a0where you will find\u00a0kids\u00a0like you.\u201d\u00a0And\u00a0I\u00a0did..Explore Baltimore Fishbowl Baltimore Farmers' Market & Bazaar returning on April 4 with reduced capacity Thursday afternoon headlines: Baltimore officials urge caution during Easter gatherings; Cocaine found on ship near Annapolis; and more Maryland's average COVID-19 positivity rate, daily new cases continue to rise Maryland's Spookiest Ghost Towns Topgolf has paused new construction, but BDC still expects work on Baltimore location by the summer There Are More Than 16 Kinds of Rowhouses in Baltimore"}
