I still communicate with some of them so I was happy for them, but I\u2019m really focused on the Ducks right now.\u201dOmoruyi sat out the 2019-20 season due to NCAA transfer rules, and underwent knee surgery during the year off. Now the Rexdale, Ontario native is averaging 16.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists for the Ducks. He went for 17 points, six rebounds, five assists, two blocks and two assists in Oregon\u2019s 95-80 throttling of Luka Garza and No. 2 Iowa in the second round.Omoruyi\u2019s decision to transfer came as a shock at the time, but he said it was motivated not only by basketball reasons but by qualify of life concerns as well. The lush green city he now plays in bears his first name, after all.\u201cGreat coach and program,\u201d he said of Oregon coach Dana Altman. \u201cHe\u2019s really a players\u2019 coach. All the coaches are great, they work with you, they develop your game and they\u2019re always there for you day in and day out.\u201cEugene, Oregon is a very nice city, quiet, allows you to focus on basketball, no distractions,\u201d he added. \u201cIt gets you into the right mindset for the next level you want to get to. I really enjoyed it, that\u2019s why I chose there.\u201dAltman, who is closing in on 700 career wins, watched Omoruyi play at  and was well aware of his talents.\u201cWell, yeah, I saw him play on the Big Ten Network, I watch those games at night,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI get an opportunity to see all teams play. We\u2019ve had great success with the young guys that we\u2019ve had from Canada over the years and he was a great fit for us.\u201dHe added: \u201cEugene plays so hard and he\u2019s been such a pleasure to work with. He had such a tough year last year, with the knee surgery to repair some injuries that he had at Rutgers. Then the  hit so he was working out on his own.\u201cHis physicality, his leadership, his mental toughness, for our coaching staff he\u2019s been a complete pleasure to work with.\u201dOmoruyi is one of several transfers on the Oregon roster, including former St. John\u2019s wing L.J. Figueroa, who got a waiver to play immediately this season after transferring and is averaging 12.6 points and 6.2 rebounds. He went for 21 points and seven rebounds in the Iowa gameAsked how his role at Oregon is different from Rutgers, Omoruyi said: \u201cJust my feel for the game, me playing basketball the right way, me knowing the in and outs of the game. With having such a great coach as coach Altman, he\u2019s taught me a lot of things about the game that I didn\u2019t know when I was at Rutgers, and just coming here and competing and putting in the work ethic and working on my shot and my dribble and some other things, I feel like has really elevated my game to the next step that I need to get to.\u201dAgainst USC, he will battle again 7-footer Evan Mobley, \u201cHe can move, he has a real soft touch around the rim and he reads the game,\u201d Omoruyi said.He added: \u201cI\u2019m really excited, I wanted this game in the Pac-12 Tournament but I\u2019m just happy to get it now. I\u2019m a competitor and I\u2019m just ready to go.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
