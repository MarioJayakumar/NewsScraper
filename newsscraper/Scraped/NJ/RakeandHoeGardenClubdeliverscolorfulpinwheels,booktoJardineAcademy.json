This year, Rake & Hoe Garden Club member Mary Lou Nolas made 100 colorful pinwheels. The ornaments were inspired by \u201cGilberto and the Wind\u201d by Marie Hall Ets.

He sees how his bubbles fly away, his pinwheels twirl around, and his paper boat sails across the water.Nolas delivered a copy of the book and 100 pinwheel ornaments to Jardine Academy on March 9. The academy staff will read the story to the students and decorate the tree. After enjoying the tree for a couple of weeks, each student will receive a pinwheel to take home.The Jardine Academy, operated by the Cerebral Palsy League and approved by the New Jersey Department of Education, provides an educational program designed to meet the cognitive and physical needs of children and young adults, 3 to 21 with multiple disabilities.The Rake and Hoe Garden Club is affiliated with the Garden Club of New Jersey and the National Garden Club Inc.
