As a result, patrons can no longer borrow from the four area libraries that helped Westfield when the library was closed.\u201cThe Westfield Memorial Library is incredibly grateful to the Clark, Cranford, Mountainside and Scotch Plains Libraries for their help in providing services to Westfield residents while the library was closed,\u201d said director Phil Israel. \u201cThey changed their policies and protocols to permit our patrons to borrow their materials. However, we do not want to overstay our welcome, so please return materials to the originating libraries when you have finished with them.\u201dBeginning March 29, Westfield residents will be able to reserve materials. Patrons can pick up reserved materials curbside Monday through Thursday 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; and Sunday 1 to 4:30 p.m.Westfield patrons can still access the library\u2019s digital services and online programs by visiting the library\u2019s website at  or the library\u2019s facebook page.
