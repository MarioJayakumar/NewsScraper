But the Devils managed to emerge from both unscathed.Here are three takeaways from the game.A high stick hitting the puck in the final seconds may have made Blackwood\u2019s final save of the night unnecessary, but that didn\u2019t retract from the difficulty and athleticism needed to keep it out of the net.As the deflected puck drifted toward the left post, Blackwood sprawled out in desperation to kick it toward the wall just before it crossed the red goal line entirely.\u201cYou just push and kick your leg out at it as best you can,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cI saw it kind of going in, so I was like, \u2018welp, here we go.\u2019 Then just give it the best effort you got.\u201dVideo review of Blackwood\u2019s kick save upheld the call on the ice of no goal, but it wasn\u2019t the only drama of the final 90 seconds.The Bruins appeared to tie the game with 1:10 left in regulation when Patrice Bergeron knocked in a loose puck at the left post after they started skating 6-on-5.As Devils head coach Lindy Ruff saw the play unfold and the puck enter the net, he didn\u2019t need to consult the replay before knowing what he was going to do.\u201dImmediately when I saw it, it looked like they pitchforked (Blackwood) when he basically had the puck covered,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cI said to the other coaches, I\u2019m challenging it for sure. I think you can be wrong, you can be right. Some of these challenges are really hard, but the way my goaltender played, it\u2019s one that you have to challenge.\u201dGoaltender interference challenges can be unpredictable, but fortunately for Ruff and the Devils, the officials agreed Bruins forward David Krejci dislodged the covered puck from under Blackwood\u2019s glove, resulting in the goal getting overturned.Blackwood felt from the get go that the goal would be disallowed, as he reacted almost immediately following the shot. On both reviews in the final two minutes, he didn\u2019t shy away from watching the replays on the video board.\u201cI want to see what happened. I respect the game, so if it was the right call, it was the right call,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cSo I want to know if it was in or not, and I want to know if I had a cover or if I didn\u2019t have a cover \u2014 I mean, I knew I had it covered before the replayed that one \u2014 but the way the replays go, you want to see. You want to see what\u2019s happening from a different angle.\u201dOn top of the two video reviews, referees went to the monitor a third time after Blackwood\u2019s final save was upheld, just to check the time and the players on the ice following a Devils icing. Mercifully, the Devils were able to finally celebrate their win.\u201cIt definitely felt like it took a long time,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cMackenzie played a great game. He made some huge stops there down the stretch in the third period, and we\u2019re happy that the reviews worked out in our favor, and we\u2019ll take it.\u201dJanne Kuokkanen was called for a double minor early in the third period when a high stick drew blood on Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy. Clinging to their 1-0 lead, the Devils needed a lockdown effort from their penalty kill.The Devils got just that, with Blackwood making four saves over the four minutes to keep the lead in tact.\u201cThe penalty kill has been a source of strength for us and momentum over the last couple of weeks,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cHopefully it continues to do that. Those guys are working really hard on making sure they\u2019re doing the right things and keeping the puck out of our net.\u201dThe Devils finished 4-for-4 on the penalty kill on Sunday, and in March, they\u2019ve allowed just six power-play goals on 44 chances. Their 86.3% kill rate this month is a stark improvement from the 52% kill rate they posted in February.During that four-minute penalty kill, forwards Jesper Bratt and Andreas Johnsson were both on the ice for a shift that lasted more than two minutes. Defensemen Sami Vatanen and Dmitri Kulikov were out for nearly as long, skating for around 1:45.With tired legs, they managed to eventually clear the puck and get off the ice without any harm.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief for them and the new guys coming over that we can get fresh legs,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cBad stuff happens when you get stuck out there for a long time and get tired. So they did a great job of not running around and getting out of position with just holding their box and being smart with when to attack and when to hold.\u201dWhile the Devils have struggled mightily against the this season, it\u2019s been the complete opposite against the Bruins.Sunday\u2019s win pushed the Devils to 4-0-1 against Boston in 2020-21, including a 3-0-0 mark at TD Garden. Of the Devils\u2019 three shutout wins this season, two have come against the Bruins.The Bruins have been one of the league\u2019s worst teams at scoring 5-on-5 goals this season, netting just 1.96 per 60 minutes to rank 29th in the NHL, but the Devils have still allowed a remarkable zero 5-on-5 goals against the Bruins in five games this season.The Devils will play their final game at TD Garden on Tuesday before the Bruins visit Prudential Center in Newark two times in May.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
