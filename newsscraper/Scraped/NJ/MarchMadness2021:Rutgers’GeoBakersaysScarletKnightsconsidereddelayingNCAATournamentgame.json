So it ended up not going through.\u201dWhile there was interest on both sides, there was also fear, Baker said.\u201cEvery time I talked to Clemson players, you could tell they wanted to do it, but what were their coaches going to think? What were our coaches going to think? Does that mess up your mental for the game?\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it was a unique situation because we hadn\u2019t made the tournament in 30 years, so I didn\u2019t want to ask guys to go out of their way to delay something or protest something Rutgers fans haven\u2019t seen in a really long time. It was tough, but it was definitely talked about.\u201dBaker is part of a trio of players, alongside Iowa\u2019s Jordan Bohannon and Michigan\u2019s Isaiah Livers, leading the #NotNCAAProperty movement ahead of the NCAA Tournament. Both Baker and Livers wore #NotNCAAProperty shirts during pregame warm-ups last week.The group attempted to arrange a meeting with NCAA President Mark Emmert about the movement this week. Emmert agreed to meet , which  questioning why he isn\u2019t meeting with the players sooner.\u201cWe are disappointed that you intend to delay this important conversation for at least two weeks,\u2019' Baker co-wrote in a letter along with Iowa guard Jordan Bohannon and Michigan guard Isaiah Livers. \u201cFrom our perspective, it\u2019s difficult to imagine any higher priority you may have at this time than addressing concerns that are at the core of state and federal college athletes\u2019 rights legislation, an upcoming US Supreme Court ruling on college athletes\u2019 freedoms, and the NCAA\u2019s ongoing discriminatory treatment of female basketball players in its tournament. Can you please explain what you will be doing over the next two weeks that is more important than addressing these matters?\u201dThe  requested a Tuesday morning meeting to, according to executive director Ramogi Huma, \u201cdiscuss the NCAA\u2019s prohibition on college athlete compensation for use of their name, image and likeness as well as the unacceptable discriminatory treatment of female athletes in the NCAA March Madness Tournament and throughout NCAA member institutions.\u2019'Emmert reportedly tabled the meeting until after the NCAA championship game on April 5, which sparked the latest public rebuke from a coalition of players that includes Rutgers\u2019 star senior guard.\u201cAlthough my season has ended, I will continue to use my voice to fight for what\u2019s right. ,\u2019' Baker wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.Baker has been at the , questioning the NCAA rules that restrict players from earning money off potential marketing opportunities throughout a season that concluded with Rutgers losing in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity we have here, but that doesn\u2019t mean the system is perfect,\u2019' Baker told reporters in February. \u201cMy name, image and likeness (are) owned by someone else. That\u2019s just how I view it. \u2026 You see people with academic scholarships, they don\u2019t have that problem. I feel like everyone on our team earned our scholarships, but we also earned our own name as well. That\u2019s just (marketing) opportunities for us that we deserve.\u2019'The college sports governing body has been pressured by lawmakers in recent months.U.S. Sen. in July that would give athletes a share of the profits generated by their sport after accounting for the value of their scholarships. The  would also allow them to endorse products and get paid for using their names and images.\u201cThe NCAA has exploited generations of college athletes for its own personal financial gain by preventing athletes from earning any meaningful compensation and failing to keep the athletes under its charge healthy and safe,\u2019' Booker said.The NCAA in January canceled a scheduled vote on whether to change its rules to allow athletes to collect NIL payments starting in August 2021.Earlier this month, a group of players from 15 NCAA Tournament teams created the #NotNCAAProperty while calling on the NCAA to allow for freedom to secure representation and receive pay for use of NIL by July 1.In their letter , Baker, Bohannon and Livers rebuked Emmert for, they wrote, his \u201capparent attempt to narrow the participation\u2019' of their meeting. They requested the meeting include Huma, the NCPA executive director, who \u201ca player\u2019s health and safety has never been a priority\u2019' to the NCAA.\u201cThey\u2019re unpaid, without any representation, and they\u2019re used and abused to make coaches and conference commissioners rich and to give colleges a lot of branding and advertising,\u2019' he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the function.\u2019'The Scarlet Knights defeated  in what was the program\u2019s first NCAA Tournament win since the 1982-83 season.
