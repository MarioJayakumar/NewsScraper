What if he had picked Villanova, Kansas, Stanford, UCLA or Virginia instead of ?\u201cI would just think about [how] back in high school I had pretty much every offer I could ask for and just finding the right fit from the jump for me, how different my life would be right now,\u201d Quinerly recalled Thursday on a Zoom call in response to a question from NJ Advance Media.\u201cBut I\u2019m happy where I am right now. I\u2019m a true believer that everything happens for a reason and I\u2019m in a great program right now, a great system. I got a great coaching staff so I\u2019m just blessed to be where I\u2019m at right now.\u201dWhere the 6-foot-1, 175-pound Hackensack native sits now is playing a crucial role off the bench for No. 2 Alabama as they get set to face No. 11 UCLA in a Sweet 16 matchup on Sunday (7:15 p.m. ET on TBS). Quinerly is averaging 12.7 points, 3.2 assists and 2.1 rebounds for the Crimson Tide (26-6), the only major-conference program to win both its regular-season title and conference tournament crown.Quinerly was named the Most Outstanding Player of the SEC Tournament after averaging 17.0 points and 3.0 assists in wins over Mississippi State, Tennessee and LSU.The moment took on special significance because his parents, Mark and Caren, were on hand in Nashville to witness it.\u201cIt was just special having my parents there, especially every thing that they\u2019ve been through,\u201d Quinerly said. \u201cAnd winning a regular-season championship and an SEC tournament championship ... that was obviously special and that was the goal we set a long time ago that we accomplished.\u201dIt has been a long journey for Quinerly and his parents since he first committed to Arizona and found himself part of a federal investigation into then-Arizona assistant Emanuel \u201cBook\u201d Richardson, who had visited him at Hudson Catholic during recruiting.Richardson, who later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery, had been accused of taking $20,000 in bribes and planning to use $15,000 of it toward a top point guard. Richardson was caught on a wiretape played in court saying that he paid Quinerly and his family $10,000 of out of his own pocket with the intention of giving him an extra $5,000 to commit to Arizona. Neither Quinerly nor his mother were named in the federal documents.Richardson\u2019s attorney, Craig Mordock, said the coach kept the money for himself.\u201cMr. Richardson never gave them the money and did not jeopardize their careers in basketball,\u201d Mordock wrote in a sentencing memorandum.In early 2018, Quinerly , the first major program to offer him a scholarship as a freshman.\u201cThe honest reason I didn\u2019t stay committed [to Arizona] was because after the allegations came out, and me and my family were accused of taking money, we didn\u2019t hear from [Arizona coach] Sean Miller for a week,\u201d Quinerly . \u201cAnd nobody was defending us. It took about two years for the truth to come out.\u201dMeantime, former Villanova assistant Ashley Howard, who had recruited Quinerly, left the school to become the head coach at La Salle.Quinerly spent the 2018-19 season playing a limited role off the bench for Jay Wright\u2019s team, while also going through counseling trying to work things out.\u201cFor two years, people on social media, fans all across the country at all these different schools \u2014 because you know the FBI probe was a hot topic for a while \u2014 everyone just accused me and my family of taking money and we just had to kind of sit back and take it,\u201d Quinerly told the AP. \u201cI told my family, \u2018We\u2019re not going to sit here and go back and forth with everybody on social media.\u2019\u201cSo we kind of just had to take it until the truth revealed itself years later.\u201dWhen Alabama coach Nate Oats took the job in 2019, he looked at the roster and realized he needed another point guard, and saw that Quinerly, a former McDonald\u2019s All-American, was in the transfer portal.\u201cQuinerly was one of the best point guards in [the portal] based on his high school numbers,\u201d Oats said Thursday in response to a question from NJ Advance Media. \u201cSo we made the call. We talked to his parents. Bryan Hodgson, my assistant, went down and visited with his parents and they explained the whole story, Bryan explained it to me and their story is what it is. They\u2019ve told the truth the whole time, it\u2019s come out in court. They never asked for any money, they were never offered any money.\u201cTheir name got drug through the mud a lot ... He obviously was cleared at Villanova to play. The Arizona thing was in the past.\u201dSo Quinerly . Oats and Alabama sought an NCAA waiver to get him immediate eligibility because of everything he had been through, but the NCAA denied it and Quinerly ended up sitting out the 2020-21 season, having to watch from the bench.\u201cOne of my lows [was] just sitting out for two years,\u201d Quinerly said Thursday in response to a question from NJ Advance Media.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy not playing as much as I thought I would play at Villanova and then the NCAA denying my waiver so I had to sit a whole other year so I kind of feel like I lost two valuable years. And even though that was one of my lows, I tried to turn a negative into a positive by making sure I\u2019m watching the game from a different perspective and just making sure when my time comes I\u2019m 100% ready.\u201dNow Quinerly is thriving for an up-tempo Alabama team that fits his style more than Villanova\u2019s more rigid system. Quinerly and the Tide are trying to match the school\u2019s vaunted football program by winning a national championship.\u201cHe\u2019s been all about the team, he hasn\u2019t had a problem coming off the bench,\u201d Oats said. \u201cHe comes in and changes the pace of the game as soon as he gets in. He\u2019s playing starter\u2019s minutes. We like bringing some firepower off the bench and he\u2019s done that.\u201cI think his defense has gotten significantly better. He\u2019s bought into playing both sides of the ball. He\u2019s got that New Jersey toughness and he\u2019s bringing it out on the defensive end. He means a lot to us.\u201dThe other day, Quinerly popped in to the Villanova team room in Indianapolis to say hello to Wright and the Wildcats, who were set to face Baylor on Saturday.Even though things didn\u2019t work out for Quinerly at Villanova, Wright is \u201creally happy for him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s found the perfect spot,\u201d Wright said in a text message. \u201cHe was a good teammate, everyone wants him to be successful and he\u2019s doing it . He is successful because he\u2019s in the perfect system. That\u2019s what you want for every player - find the right fit.\u201dAfter all he and his family have been through, Jahvon Quinerly has finally found the perfect place.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
