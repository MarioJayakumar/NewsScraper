{"title": "Rutgers\u2019 Mike Tverdov could be set for breakout season after accepting Greg Schiano\u2019s challenge", "body": " challenged .Play hard, and to your maximum effort, on every snap. Simple as that.The defensive end from Union took it to heart. By the end of the fall, he was \u2019 best defensive lineman.\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to take plays off in this league,\u201d Tverdov said recently. \u201cLast year I was 6-foot-3, 250 pounds. I\u2019m not a guy who can sit in the gap and take plays off. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201cSwarm and finish every play, giving every single play your maximum effort is how things are going to turn out for you. I think that\u2019s the mindset I developed later in the season. Not only did I start playing harder, but I started believing in our system, believing in the coaching. It helped our defense and it helped me personally. I\u2019m looking to go as hard as I can on every single play and see how far I can push myself.\u201dTverdov racked up 19 tackles (six for a loss) and four sacks in the Scarlet Knights\u2019 final three games of the season. It was a significant surge for a player who had just 17 tackles in the first six games, and it raised expectations for a breakout 2021,  \u2013 which is currently on hold due to a  pause.\u201cHe loves to play the game of football. I think he prepares, and he\u2019s learning how to prepare within our system. And then when you have some positive actions go for you, things really start to be on the uptick,\u201d defensive coordinator Robb Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s set the bar for himself now in terms of preparation and how he needs to respond. We\u2019re excited to see him this spring and that\u2019s got to carry on into the fall.\u201dTverdov tied for the team lead in sacks as a redshirt freshman in 2018, then started 10 games as a redshirt sophomore in 2019. He frequently made flash plays, but his presence was not consistently felt. He was also forced to play somewhat out of position in 2019 in the scheme used by former coach Chris Ash and his staff. Tverdov has been a strong fit for Schiano\u2019s defense, though, just as  \u2013 was.It was just a matter of accepting the challenge.\u201cI was just doing my job. That\u2019s something we really preach in this program, in this defense. Not putting yourself before others, doing what you\u2019re supposed to do when you\u2019re supposed to do it,\u201d Tverdov said. \u201cSometimes there are going to be games where you don\u2019t make as many plays as you wanted to, but as long as you did your job that\u2019s all that matters.\u201cIt came down to me getting a cluster of plays I happened to make. That\u2019s a tribute to me doing my job, the defense that we\u2019re in and everybody on the side of the ball doing what they\u2019re supposed to do. I\u2019m looking to build upon that and get even better this offseason to see what I can do next season.\u201d. He may be on track for the honor this fall due to his on-field production and growing leadership role as a veteran who has seen a lot \u2013 back-to-back winless Big Ten seasons, a coaching change and now the program\u2019s budding renaissance.\u201cNot everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows here,\u201d Tverdov said. \u201cThere are going to be really hard days where you may question yourself. But that\u2019s what college football is about. It\u2019s about grinding through those tough days that turn you into a better football player and more importantly a better man.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
