{"title": "NFL Draft 2021: Here\u2019s how Daniel Jeremiah says Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold stacks up vs. Zach Wilson, Justin Fields as QB decision looms", "body": "BYU quarterback Zach Wilson could be drafted by the Jets.  general manager  needs to figure out if BYU\u2019s \u2014 or maybe another quarterback in the  \u2014 is better than It\u2019s really that simple, though .Through three seasons, Darnold has mostly failed to impress. But the Jets haven\u2019t exactly surrounded him with a stellar supporting cast or coaching staff.Still, Douglas could pull the plug on the Darnold era this spring, by taking Wilson with the second overall draft pick. And with that in mind, here\u2019s how NFL Network\u2019s Daniel Jeremiah ranks Darnold (right now, not coming out of college) against this draft\u2019s quarterbacks:(Let me try this again)Interesting to insert Sam Darnold\u2019s availability into this draft class. Obviously, that will determine what the Jets do at pick 2. For me, he would be 3rd. 1) Trevor Lawrence 2) Zach Wilson3) Sam Darnold 4) Trey Lance5) Justin Fields6) Mac JonesSo from Jeremiah\u2019s perspective, the 49ers \u2014 who traded up from No. 12 to No. 3 \u2014 would be better off taking North Dakota State\u2019s Lance than Ohio State\u2019s Fields.Earlier in the pre-draft process, Fields was considered the best quarterback prospect not named Trevor Lawrence in this draft. But Wilson has since surpassed him. Which is why \u2014 as Douglas (so far) hasn\u2019t traded out of No. 2 \u2014 many analysts think he\u2019ll wind up with the Jets.Jeremiah, at least, believes that would be an upgrade.Look, it\u2019s tough to compare a quarterback with zero NFL experience, like Wilson, to a quarterback who has an established \u2014 albeit rather rocky \u2014 body of work, like Darnold.Concerns \u2014 lack of experience, level of competition faced \u2014 will continue to linger about Wilson, until he dispels them. And that\u2019s why \u201cDarnold or Wilson?\u201d isn\u2019t an easy choice for Douglas, whose tenure as Jets GM will largely be defined by this move.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
