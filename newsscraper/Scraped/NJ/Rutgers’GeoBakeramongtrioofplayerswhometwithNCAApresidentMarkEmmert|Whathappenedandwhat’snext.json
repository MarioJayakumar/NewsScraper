Baker explained that \u201ctheir idea is to fix the problem quickly while also providing flexibility for future changes to those rules as details are debated by state and federal lawmakers, courts and NCAA officials.\u201dNone of the players was optimistic that Emmert would take any swift action.\u201cOur meeting was the same thing he\u2019s doing in the public,\u201d Bohannon said. \u201cA lot of talk and he\u2019s waiting on Congress to decide on legislation.\u201dThe NCAA in January canceled a scheduled vote on whether to change its rules to allow athletes to collect NIL payments starting in August 2021.Several states have passed legislation that would make the NCAA\u2019s current rules illegal, with some of them scheduled to go into effect as early as this June. Emmert and the NCAA have asked federal lawmakers to create a national rule that would open opportunities for college athletes to make money with some restrictions on the types of deals they could sign.Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who co-authored a bill last year that would bring sweeping reform to college sports and push the NCAA to go beyond NIL rights in providing more for athletes, met with the players following their meeting with Emmert and then held a press conference. They both adamantly disagreed with the idea that the NCAA needed to wait on Congress before creating its own rule changes, per ESPN.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear sign of lack of leadership,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cHe wants Congress to help him. Well, we\u2019re going to help him. We\u2019re going to give him help. The help we\u2019re going to give him is not help to the NCAA, though. It\u2019s help to the athletes.\u201dThe plan is to meet with Emmert again in the future, according to the players, with the hope they will be included in other meetings with NCAA decision-makers.None of the three players has announced whether he plans to take advantage of the extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA last summer and return in the 2021-22 season.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission."}
