This year, it brings people together and gives them hope. That\u2019s what Easter is all about.\u201dWhile in Austria and elsewhere, people use wooden rattles to make the noise, believers in Ceske Budejovice returned about 10 years ago to a tradition of using small wooden carts for the Easter rattling, or clattering, as it\u2019s also known.The processions take place through Easter Sunday.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at:https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemichttps://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccinehttps://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"}
