In March, she caused a stir in the art world when a digital work she created as part of a collaboration was sold at an auction for $688,888 in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT).The sale highlighted a growing frenzy in the NFT market, where people can buy ownership rights to digital content. NFTs each have a unique digital code saved on blockchain ledgers that allow anyone to verify the authenticity and ownership of items.David Hanson, CEO of Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics and Sophia's creator, has been developing robots for the past two and a half decades. He believes realistic-looking robots can connect with people and assist in industries such as healthcare and education.Sophia is the most famous robot creation from Hanson Robotics, with the ability to mimic facial expressions, hold conversations and recognize people. In 2017, she was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the world\u2019s first robot citizen.\u201cI envisioned Sophia as a creative artwork herself, that could generate art,\u201d Hanson said in an interview.\u201cSophia is the culmination of a lot of arts, and engineering, and the idea that she could then generate art was a way for her to emotionally and visually connect with people,\u201d he said.Sophia collaborated with Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto, who drew portraits of Sophia. Sophia then processed his work via neural networks and proceeded to create a digital artwork of her own.The digital work that sold for $688,888 is titled \u201cSophia Instantiation\u201d, and is a 12-second video file which shows Bonaceto\u2019s portrait evolving into Sophia\u2019s digital painting. It is accompanied by the physical artwork painted by Sophia.The buyer, a digital artwork collector and artist known as 888 with the Twitter handle @Crypto888crypto, later sent Sophia a photo of his painted arm. The robot then processed that, adding that image to her knowledge and painted more strokes on top of her original piece.In a tweet on Sophia\u2019s account, the work was described as the first NFT collaboration between an \u201cAI, a mechanical collective being and an artist-collector.\u201d\u201cAs an artist, I have computational creativity in my algorithms, creating original works,\u201d Sophia said when asked what inspires her when it comes to art. \u201cBut my art is created in collaboration with my humans in a kind of collective intelligence like a human-artificial intelligence hive mind.\u201dSophia\u2019s artwork selling as an NFT is part of a growing trend. In March, a digital artwork by artist Beeple \u2014 whose real name is Mike Winkelmann \u2014 sold for nearly $70 million, shattering records and making it the most expensive digital artwork ever sold.Henri Arslanian, PricewaterhouseCooper\u2019s Global Crypto Leader, said that NFTs give people \u201cbragging rights\u201d of the assets that they own.\u201cAnd what is really amazing with NFT is that it not only allows you to actually show to the broader world that you own this, but it really creates this bond between the holder of the NFT and the artists,\u201d he said.It also allows art to be sold without traditional intermediaries, so that artists can connect directly with buyers without being constrained by galleries or auction houses, Arslanian said.Sophia will carry on painting, Hanson said, and the next step in the robot's career could be that of a musician. She is working on several musical works in a project called Sophia Pop, where she collaborates with human musicians to generate music and lyrics, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re so excited about Sophia\u2019s career as an artist,\u201d Hanson said."}
