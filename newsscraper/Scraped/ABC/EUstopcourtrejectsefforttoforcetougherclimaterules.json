They hoped to draw attention to the impact that climate policy had on individuals and those fighting for         starving Arctic reindeer and other environmental issues.The European General Court acknowledged that the plaintiffs are generally affected by climate change but rejected the case in 2019 on procedural grounds. The families and youth group appealed to the European Court of Justice, or ECJ, the bloc\u2019s top court.The ECJ upheld the lower court\u2019s decision Thursday, saying the plaintiffs \u201care not individually concerned\u201d by the EU\u2019s climate legislation so the case won't be heard.\u201cThe Sami people live in the middle of the climate crisis every day. We see how the climate crisis affects the reindeer, nature and our culture,\" Sanna Vannar of the Sami youth organization told reporters. \"It makes me so angry and frustrated that the EU does not take this problem seriously and address it like an emergency.\u201dPlaintiff Alfredo Sendim, a Portuguese farmer who has struggled with season after season of drought, said: \u201dThe court\u2019s decision is disappointing, but we will not give up. We will continue seeking protection of our rights and demand climate protection.\"Environmental activists held a small protest in Brussels after the ruling.After the legal effort was launched, the European Commission proposed a \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d with more ambitious goals toward fighting climate change. European Union leaders         reached a deal last year to cut the bloc\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, more than the previous goal of 40%.Experts say ending the use of fossil fuels is one of the most important measures needed to limit global warming, which is believed to be causing stronger storms, fiercer droughts and other weather problems that are damaging lives and livelihoods around the world.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow all AP developments on climate change issues at         https://apnews.com/hub/Climate."}
