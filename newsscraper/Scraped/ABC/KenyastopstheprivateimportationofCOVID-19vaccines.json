Only U.K. citizens and those holding residency permits will be allowed to enter Britain from Kenya, it said.The British High Commission stressed that these are temporary measures.Kenya responded Saturday by making it mandatory for all passengers originating from or transiting through U.K. airports to undergo 14 days of quarantine at a government facility at their own cost.

Rather the decision seems to be motivated by a discriminatory policy against certain countries and peoples,\u201d Kenya's Foreign Affairs Ministry said."}
