{"title": "'Treating us like robots': Amazon workers seek union", "body": "Amazon workers and labor advocates are making a final push for the union vote at the company's warehouse outside Birmingham, AlabamaBESSEMER, Ala. -- Linda Burns was excited at first to land a job at the  warehouse outside Birmingham, Alabama. The former nursing assistant had always enjoyed ordering from the company, Now, she would be working for them.A cog in a fast-moving assembly line, her job involved picking up customers' orders and sending them down the line to the packers. Now she is a staunch supporter of getting a union at the Bessemer facility. She said employees face relentless quotas and deserve more respect.\u201cThey are treating us like robots rather than humans,\u201d said Burns, 51, who said she is out of leave after developing tendonitis.This week,  workers and union advocates, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, made a last-minute push as voting comes to a close in the high-stakes union battle. If organizers are successful, it could lead to a chain reaction of other unionization pushes at Amazon facilities. If voted down, it would be another loss for organizers hoping to win a         rare labor victory in the Deep South.Amazon is fighting the union. The company argues the warehouse created thousands of jobs with an average pay of $15.30 per hour \u2014 more than twice the minimum wage in Alabama. Workers also get benefits including health care, vision and dental insurance without paying union dues, the company said.Sanders spoke at a union rally in Birmingham on Friday, saying a labor victory against the tech and retail giant owned by the richest person in world \u2014 and in a historically anti-union state \u2014 would resonate across the country.\u201cWhat you are doing here is historical, historical, because all over this country people are sick and tired of being exploited, sick and tired of not having the dignity that they deserve. And your message to people all over this country is stand up and fight back,\u201d Sanders said.\u201cThis country belongs to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires,\" the former Democratic presidential candidate said.Ahead of Sanders\u2019 visit, Amazon CEO Dave Clark tweeted that they \u201cactually deliver\u201d a progressive workplace with a $15 hourly minimum wage and good health benefits that Sanders said he supports.\u201cSo, if you want to hear about $15 an hour and health care, Senator Sanders will be speaking downtown. But if you would like to make at least $15 an hour and have good health care, Amazon is hiring,\u201d Clark tweeted.Burns and Harvey Wilson, a 41-year-old who works as a \u201cpicker\u201d at Amazon, both said they're supporting the union because of poor working conditions at the warehouse. Employees face relentless quotas and the mammoth size of the facility makes it nearly impossible to get to the bathroom and back to your station during a workers' break time, they said.\u201cHow could you work for somebody who is trillion, billion whatever you want to call it, how can you work for them and they don\u2019t want you to go to the bathroom?\u201d Burns said.Wilson said he is unsure how the vote would go because a number of younger workers are fearful they could lose benefits.\u201cA lot of people are scared to vote because they are afraid they are going to lose their jobs,\u201d Wilson said.Employees are seeking to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Ballots on the vote must be returned by Monday.The vote in Alabama comes after efforts to start unions at Southern auto plants came up short.Emmit Ashford, a part-time Amazon worker, said that even if the vote fails, he believes the workers in Bessemer have ignited something.\u201cNo matter what happens with this vote, the bell has been rung and it won\u2019t stop here. We will not stop fighting,\u201d Ashford said at a rally ahead of the vote."}
