Other video showed debris raining down and explosions could be heard.\"At least the crater is in the right place!\"  chief executive  tweeted.Musk said \u201csomething significant\u201d happened shortly after the engine firings for landing: \"Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.\u201d In addition, one of the three engines had trouble during the ascent, he noted.This was the fourth full-scale stainless steel model to launch since December to an altitude of more than 6 miles (10 kilometers). The previous three exploded at touchdown or shortly afterward. The prototype is 164 feet (50 meters) tall.\u201cAnother exciting test, as we say,\u201d  launch commentator John Insprucker said as he concluded the webcast.A newer version of the rocket has undergone hundreds of design changes, according to Musk.\"Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem,\" he said.SpaceX plans to use Starship to send astronauts and cargo to the moon and, ultimately, Mars. Musk said earlier this month that SpaceX will be landing Starships on Mars \u201cwell before 2030.\u201d But he noted that \u201cthe really hard threshold is making Mars Base Alpha self-sustaining.\u201dMusk has named the launch and landing area at the southeastern tip of Texas, near the Mexico border, Starbase. A few hour after Tuesday\u2019s failure, he urged people to move to the area, saying on  that he\u2019s looking to hire several thousand people over the next year or two \u2014 engineers, technicians, builders, workers of all sorts. He said he\u2019s also donating millions to the local school district and nearby city of Brownsville.\u2014\u2014\u2014The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
