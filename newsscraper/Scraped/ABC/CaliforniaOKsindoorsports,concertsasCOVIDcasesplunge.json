Big population centers like San Francisco, Santa Clara County and Los Angeles County are in the second-least restrictive orange tier. Only three counties \u2014 San Joaquin, Merced and Inyo \u2014 remain in the highest purple tier, indicating \u201cwidespread\" COVID-19 risk.The others will be permitted some indoor seating \u201cwith capacity limits and modifications including physical distancing, advance ticket purchases, designated areas for eating and drinking, and attendance limited to in-state visitors,\" according to a state public health announcement.In the red tier, venues of up to 1,500 people can operate at 10% capacity and grow to 25% if all guests provide evidence of vaccination or a negative test. Venues of 1,501 people or more can operate at 20% capacity in the red tier, but guests must show proof of vaccination or a negative test. Capacity increases for tiers where the virus is less widespread.State officials won\u2019t require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don\u2019t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances.The Los Angeles Lakers announced that fans will be allowed back into Staples Center for an April 15 game against the Boston Celtics.\u201cObviously we don\u2019t know exactly how many fans will be there yet, but just having some in there will bring us great energy,\" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of everybody\u2019s favorite things to do is go to Lakers games, and they haven\u2019t been able to do that during this pandemic.\"Ben Bleiman, a San Francisco nightlife activist and chairman of the California Music and Culture Association, said venues need full capacity to make any money \u2014 but members will take the change, albeit with trepidation.\u201cOn the one side you have the thrill and the joy of reopening,\u201d he said, adding on the other, \u201cthere\u2019s some dread that something\u2019s going to go wrong.\u201dCalifornia has been easing COVID-19 restrictions as it recovers from a deadly winter surge, although public health officials still urge people to follow social distancing and mask-wearing protocols. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths have plunged, and the rate of people testing positive for the virus is at a near-record low.California's rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination. The changes do not mention requiring proof of vaccination and put much of the enforcement on business owners and operators.\u201cAllowing some of these activities and opportunities to vaccinated individuals is an incentive,\u201d said Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development. \u201cIf they can return to some of their favorite activities because they\u2019re vaccinated, then hopefully a few more people will go and get vaccinated.\u201dThe new rules seem to nudge California toward a system of vaccine verification, a hotly debated issue across the country. New York has launched a digital pass residents can use to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test that is accepted at major entertainment venues. But Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Friday banning businesses from requiring so-called \u201cvaccine passports.\u201dPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration has said the federal government won\u2019t come up with a national vaccine passport app, leaving that to the private sector. But the federal government is devising regulations for how and when those passports can be used.California Public Health Officer Dr. Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n said Friday the state will follow the federal government\u2019s lead but said vaccinations won\u2019t be required for essential services.California\u2019s new rules come as the state has administered nearly 19 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Nearly 6.9 million people are fully vaccinated in a state with close to 40 million residents. Only people 50 and over are eligible statewide to get the vaccine now, followed by those 16 and older on April 15.\u2014\u2014\u2014Har reported from San Francisco."}
