Usually a long, late-night ritual, this year's vigil service also started earlier than usual to respect \u2019s 10 p.m. COVID-19 curfew.But the service began in the dramatic way it always does, with the pope lighting a single candle in the darkened basilica and then sharing its flame with others until the pews slowly begin to twinkle and the basilica's lights are turned on.In his homily, Francis said Easter offers a message of hope and new starts.\u201cIn these dark months of the pandemic, let us listen to the risen Lord as he invites us to begin anew and never lose hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is always possible to begin anew, because there is a new life that God can awaken in us in spite of all our failures.\u201dFrancis, who again eschewed a facemask, limped considerably through the service, in a sign that he is suffering through a prolonged bout of sciatica nerve pain.On Sunday, Francis is to preside over Easter Mass before a similarly small group of faithful and deliver his traditional \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d blessing \u201cto the city and the world.\u201d Usually the Easter Mass and blessing is celebrated before tens of thousands of people in a flower-decked St. Peter\u2019s Square.But this year Francis will celebrate the service in the basilica and deliver the blessing from the altar, to prevent crowds from forming in the piazza."}
