Get a shot, get a free doughnut, the governor said.Alabama, which has the nation's lowest vaccination rate and a county where only 7% of residents are fully vaccinated, launched a campaign to convince people the shots are safe. Doctors and pastors joined the effort.On the national level, the Biden administration this week launched a \u201cWe Can Do This\u201d campaign to encourage holdouts to get vaccinated against the virus that has claimed over 550,000 lives in the U.S.The race is on to vaccinate as many people as possible, but a significant number of Americans are so far reluctant to get the shots, even in places where they are plentiful. Twenty-five percent of Americans say they probably or definitely will not get vaccinated, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.They are leery about possible side effects. They tend to be Republican, and they are usually younger and less susceptible to becoming critically ill or dying if they catch COVID-19.There's been a slight shift, though, since the first weeks of the nation's largest-ever vaccination campaign, which began in mid-December. An AP-NORC poll conducted in late January showed that 67% of adult Americans were willing to get vaccinated or had already received at least one shot. Now that figure has climbed to 75%.That, experts say, moves the nation closer to herd immunity, which occurs when enough people have immunity, either from vaccination or past infection, to stop uncontrolled spread of a disease.Anywhere from 75% to 85% of the total population \u2014 including children, who are not currently getting the shots \u2014 should be vaccinated to reach herd immunity, said Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington School of Public Health.A little over three months after the first doses were given, 100 million Americans, or about 30% of the population, have received at least one dose.Andrea Richmond, a 26-year-old freelance web coder in Atlanta, is among those whose reluctance is easing. A few weeks ago, Richmond was leaning toward not getting the shot. Possible long-term effects worried her. She knew that an H1N1 vaccine used years ago in Europe increased risk of narcolepsy.Then her sister got vaccinated with no ill effects. Richmond's friends\u2019 opinions also changed.\u201cThey went from, \u2018I\u2019m not trusting this\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019m all vaxxed up, let\u2019s go out!\u2019\u201dHer mother, a cancer survivor, whom Richmond lives with, is so keen for her daughter to get vaccinated that she signed her up online for a jab.\u201cI\u2019ll probably end up taking it,\" Richmond said. \"I guess it\u2019s my civic duty.\u201dBut some remain steadfastly opposed.\u201cI think I only had the flu once,\u201d said Lori Mansour, 67, who lives near Rockford, Illinois. \"So I think I\u2019ll take my chances.\u201dIn the latest poll, Republicans remained more likely than Democrats to say they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, 36% compared with 12%. But somewhat fewer Republicans today are reluctant. Back in January, 44% said they would shy away from a vaccine.The hesitance can be seen in Alabama's rural Winston County, which is 96% white and where more than 90% of voters backed then-President Donald Trump last year. Only 6.9% of the county\u2019s roughly 24,000 residents are fully vaccinated, the lowest level in Alabama.Elsewhere in Alabama, health officials tried to counter problems that include reluctance in heavily Black areas where distrust of government medical initiatives runs deep. They targeted a few counties with a pro-vaccine message, especially in the old plantation region where a large percentage of the population is Black and many are poor.The campaign enlisted doctors and pastors and used virtual meetings and the radio to spread the word.Dr. Karen Landers, assistant state health officer, said the effort had positive results. For example, in Perry County, where 68% of the population of about 9,300 is Black, more than 16% of the population is fully vaccinated, among the highest levels. Officials likely will make similar efforts for other parts of the state, she said.Nationwide, 24% of Black Americans and 22% of Hispanic Americans say they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, down from 41% and 34% in January, respectively. Among white Americans, 26% now say they will not get vaccinated. In January, that number was 31%.The Biden administration\u2019s campaign features TV and social media ads. Celebrities and community and religious figures are joining the effort.Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, is trying win over the one-third of adult Iowans who will not commit to getting a vaccine by emphasizing that the shots will help return life to normal.In North Carolina's Cumberland County, fewer than 1 in 6 residents have gotten at least one shot.Amid worries there would be an unused surplus of vaccines, Cape Fear Valley Health hospital systems opened up the shots last week to everyone 16 or older.\u201cRather than have doses go unused, we want to give more people the chance to get their vaccine,\u201d said Chris Tart, a Cape Fear Valley Health vice president. \"We hope this will encourage more people to roll up their sleeve.\u201dOn Wednesday, Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, tweeted a video of him getting a free doughnut from the Krispy Kreme chain. Customers who show their vaccine card can get a free doughnut every day for the rest of the year.\u201cDo it today, guys!\u201d Cooper encouraged viewers. Nearly 36% of North Carolina adults have been at least partially vaccinated, state data show.Younger people are more likely to forgo a shot. Of those under 45, 31% say they will probably or definitely forgo a shot. Only 12% of those aged 60 and older say they will not get vaccinated.Ronni Peck, a 40-year-old mother of three from Los Angeles, is one of those who plans to avoid getting vaccinated, at least for now. She's concerned that vaccines have not been studied for long-term health effects. She senses that some friends disapprove of her stance.\u201cBut I\u2019ve stopped caring about whether or not I feel ostracized and instead have learned to spend more time caring about if I\u2019m doing the right thing for myself and my kids,\u201d Peck said.Deborah Fuller, a professor with the University of Washington School of Medicine, said if the herd immunity level cannot be reached soon, a more realistic target could be vaccinating at least 50% of the population by this summer, with a higher vaccination rate among the most vulnerable to reduce severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths.\u201cIn this scenario, the virus would persist in the population but cease being a major health threat that overburdens our health care systems,\u201d Fuller said.\u2014\u2014\u2014Selsky reported from Salem, Oregon. Fingerhut reported from Washington. Weber reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writers Bryan Anderson in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, also contributed to this story.\u2014\u2014\u2014The AP-NORC poll of 1,166 adults was conducted March 26-29 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points."}
