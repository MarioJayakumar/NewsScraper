However, some organizations said they only recently became aware of the breach.The Baltimore Sun on Thursday reported that private information of staff members and students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore was posted online this week. The school said a hacking group known as Clop gained access to Accellion in December, the Sun said.The University of Colorado and the University of Miami reported that files were accessed in January and included personal data and some health, study and research data.The Washington State Auditor's Office reported last month that information on nearly 1.5 million unemployment applicants had been stolen.Accellion released a statement in March that said it had closed \u201call known\" vulnerabilities and no new ones had been found.Ransomware attacks on a massive scale and seeking massive payouts have hit several organizations in recent months.In an unrelated attack, the computer system of one of the nation\u2019s largest school districts was hacked by a criminal gang that encrypted district data and demanded $40 million in ransom or it would erase the files and post students\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal information online. Broward County Public Schools, based in Fort Lauderdale, said in a statement Thursday that there is no indication that any personal information has been stolen and that it made no extortion payment to the ransomware gang.An epidemic of ransomware attacks has been plaguing government agencies, businesses and individuals for the past three years. Most are Russian-speaking gangs based in Eastern Europe and enjoy safe harbor from tolerant governments. The more sophisticated groups identify their targets in advance, infect networks through phishing or other means and often steal data as they plant malware that encrypts a victim\u2019s network.After the ransomware is activated, the criminals demand money to unlock the malware and refrain from posting \u2014 or selling \u2014 stolen data. In the case of corporations, that data could be trade secrets. In the case of retailers or government agencies it could be Social Security, bank account numbers and birth dates.Public school districts have been frequent targets of ransomware attacks. Overall, ransomware attacks disrupted learning at 1,681 schools, colleges, and universities in 2020 and at least 544 so far this year, said analyst Brett Callow at Emsisoft, a cybersecurity firm. Seven districts had personal data published.The average ransom paid for to hacking gangs nearly tripled from $115,000 in 2019 to $312,000 in 2020, according to the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. It said the highest ransom paid by an organization doubled last year from to $10 million, up from $5 million in 2019."}
