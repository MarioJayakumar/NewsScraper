They will join flight sponsor Jared Isaacman and another passenger for three days in orbit this fall.Isaacman also revealed some details about his Inspiration4 mission, as the four gathered Tuesday at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. He's head of Shift4 Payments, a credit card-processing company in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and is paying for what would be SpaceX's first private flight while raising money for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.Their SpaceX Dragon capsule \u2014 currently parked at the International Space Station for NASA \u2014 will launch no earlier than mid-September, aiming for an altitude of 335 miles (540 kilometers). That\u2019s 75 miles (120 kilometers) higher than the International Space Station and on a level with the Hubble Space Telescope.The capsule will be outfitted with a domed window in place of the usual space station docking mechanism for their trip.Isaacman, 38, a pilot who will serve as spacecraft commander, still won\u2019t say how much he\u2019s paying. He's donating $100 million to St. Jude, while donors so far have contributed $13 million, primarily through the lottery that offered a chance to fly in space.Hayley Arceneaux, 29, was named to the crew a month ago. The St. Jude physician assistant was treated there as a child for bone cancer.That left two capsule seats open. Proctor, 51, beat out 200 businesses and nabbed the seat reserved for a customer of Isaacman's company. An independent panel of judges chose her space art website dubbed Space2inspire.\u201cIt was like when Harry Potter found out he was a wizard, a little bit of shock and awe,\u201d Proctor told The Associated Press last week. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m the winner?\u2019\u201dSembroski, 41, donated and entered the lottery but wasn\u2019t picked in the random drawing earlier this month \u2014 his friend was. His friend declined to fly for personal reasons and offered the spot to Sembroski, who worked as a Space Camp counselor in college and volunteered for space advocacy groups.\u201cJust finding out that I\u2019m going to space was an incredible, strange, surreal event,\u201d he said.He's about to start a new job at Lockheed Martin and admits it will be a balancing act over the next six months, as the crew trains.Isaacman insists they won't cut any corners as they prepare for launch.\u201cYou don't go up on Everest, right, after just a hike in the backyard. You build your way to it,\" he told reporters.Proctor, who studied geology, applied three times to NASA\u2019s astronaut corps, coming close in 2009, and took part in simulated Mars missions in Hawaii. She was born in Guam, where her late father \u2014 a \u201cHidden Figure\u201d in her mind \u2014 worked at NASA\u2019s tracking station for the Apollo moonshots, including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s.She plans to teach from space and create art up there, too.\u201cTo me, everything that I\u2019ve done ... has brought me to this moment.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
