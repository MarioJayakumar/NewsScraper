They did not say how large a subsidy to manufacturers that might represent.Beijing has spent heavily over the past two decades to build up a Chinese chip industry, but its makers of smartphones and other technology still rely on the United States, Europe and Taiwan for their most advanced components.Then-President  cut off Huawei Technologies Ltd.\u2019s access to U.S. processor chips and other technology in 2019 in a fight over Beijing\u2019s industrial ambitions.Last year, Trump tightened curbs by prohibiting global suppliers from using U.S. technology to make chips for Huawei. That threatens to cripple its smartphone business, which was the No. 1 global seller in early 2020 but has dropped out of the top five brands.Political analysts expect little change in the U.S. position under President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump in January. The Huawei founder, Ren Zhengfei, said in February it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d sanctions will be lifted.Processor chips and other semiconductors are China\u2019s biggest single import, totaling more than $300 billion a year.Under the latest measure, machinery and raw materials \u201cthat cannot be produced or whose performance cannot meet demand\u201d will be exempt from import tax, the government said.That applies to photoresists, masks, polishing pads and liquids, silicon crystals and wafers, materials to build clean rooms and other production equipment, according to the announcement.\u2014\u2014\u2014Chinese Ministry of Finance (in Chinese): www.mof.gov.cn"}
