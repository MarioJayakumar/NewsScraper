All 1,100 students enrolled in Jefferson County School District qualified for free breakfast and lunch at school before the pandemic because of the high poverty rate.By the state of Mississippi\u2019s accounts, Jefferson County is a \u201cfailing\u201d school district, based on pre-pandemic test scores. Like other under-resourced districts, it doesn\u2019t have the money to build new schools or hire more teachers.Educators have been working to improve the district's rating: implementing a new curriculum, creating a program for parent engagement, working one-on-one with students.And for more than a year now, they have been succeeding in the most crucial and fundamental way: Driving long miles on dusty roads to ensure every child gets something to eat each day.\u201cThere\u2019s not a chance if you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re going to be able to really engage in school if you\u2019re not eating,\u201d Superintendent Adrian Hammitte said. \u201cWe know families desperately need the help. We\u2019re trying to substitute for what a lot of kids are not getting at home.\u201dJefferson County, a community of around 7,000, has one of the highest unemployment rates of any in America: 17% in January 2021 compared to the national rate of around 6.3%.Named for U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, it was originally developed as cotton plantations before the Civil War. Agriculture was always the largest industry in the rural region but with the rise of industrialization, jobs were lost and the county\u2019s tax base has crumbled. The county has the highest African American population of any in the U.S., and many families have lived in poverty for generations.Because of a lack of jobs in the area, people travel distances for work \u2014 oftentimes out of state. Many of the district\u2019s children care for younger siblings, while others are watched by grandparents.More than 50% of people in Jefferson County have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, with 30% of people fully vaccinated, according to the state Department of Health. That makes Jefferson by far the most vaccinated per-capita out of all of the state's 82 counties, largely because of the work of the Jefferson Comprehensive Health Center, a clinic that provides care based on patients' ability to pay.Yet like many predominantly Black school districts, Jefferson County School District, which is 98% Black, has been cautious about returning to in-person instruction. Families are worried after seeing          how the virus has impacted Black communities across the nation.Around 10% of people in Jefferson County have at one point tested positive for coronavirus, according to the state department of health. There was an outbreak in the school district when schools tried going back in-person in the fall.The district was mostly virtual up until February, when it slowly began offering opportunities for limited in-person instruction. Now, all students spend three days a week learning from home and two days on campus.Each morning, the cafeteria staff arrives in the dark to begin prepping the day\u2019s meals. Cafeteria Manager Sondra Smith said her employees \u2014 some of whom go to food banks to get their own meals because family members have lost jobs \u2014 volunteer to come in early and prep, before their work shift starts. Other days, they forgo their breaks to get meals done.\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re feeding the babies that need it.\u201dInmates from the Jefferson-Franklin County Correctional facility down the road come to the district to package food and load the aging buses and vans. Schools were able to purchase some new equipment with federal coronavirus funds, like coolers to keep milk cold in transit.On a recent morning, high school senior Shaneque Merritt walked to the end of her driveway to collect a handful of bags for her family.Her grandmother, Victoria Green, 61, is raising five other kids between the ages of 7 and 12.Green said before the pandemic, she worked as a private nurse caring for some of the county\u2019s older citizens. Now, she said she\u2019s had to stay home to help the kids with their schoolwork. The staggered hybrid schedule means at least one child is home every day.She said the family relies on food stamps and her husband\u2019s monthly Social Security check. It isn\u2019t enough to get by.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I ain\u2019t gonna lie about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we need, but we can\u2019t get it right now.\u201dAnnie Turner, 31, is the mother of six young children. Four are school-age. She said receiving food from the school helps supplement what she is able to provide. It\u2019s tough being the family\u2019s breadwinner during a pandemic, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s really put a strain on me - big time,\u201d she said.Like many parents, she has to travel outside the county to work. She drives more than two hours every weekend to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a 36-hour-a-week job working nights making $15 an hour at a hospital as a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit aide.\u201cYou got a lot of parents who are actually out there working to try to take care of home, and when it comes to food, you want to make sure that your family is eating well,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to just be eating ramen noodles and hot dogs all day.\u201dThe pandemic has required school districts across the country to find creative ways to get food to students.In Mississippi\u2019s capital of Jackson, a majority-Black city where all students qualify for free meals, the public school district made pick-up points for kids to get food while learning from home.But when Jefferson County started doing the same at the beginning of the pandemic, only around 75% of kids were being fed, because some families don\u2019t have vehicles or aren\u2019t able to drive. Delivering door to door, around 98% of kids are getting food.DeAmber Reynolds takes care of her 6-year-old daughter and her nephew at home during remote learning days. She has seizures and can\u2019t drive.\u201cIf I had to go to pick it up, we wouldn\u2019t be getting the meals,\u201d said Reynolds, 26, who is in graduate school studying technology management while caring for kids at home. \u201cHaving them delivered, it helps a lot. People who need them, get them.\u201dMost days, the district\u2019s buses leave the schools filled with bags and come back empty.Still, there are homes where the bus stops, and no one comes to collect the food. There are others where kids have only taken food a few times. On a recent day, the bus stopped outside a home. The driver honked. Two children peered out at the bus from a window, but didn\u2019t leave the house.\u201cWe figure they\u2019re getting food somewhere else, we hope so,\u201d cook Raquel Mims-Cole said, as she looked out at the house. \u201cBut you can\u2019t know. All we can do is keep being here every day. We\u2019ll keep on coming, as long as they need us.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Willingham is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
