Some 57.9 million people, or 17.5% of the population, have completed their vaccination.CASES: The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. increased over the past two weeks from 54,696 on March 18 to 65,684 on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.DEATHS: The seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. decreased over the past two weeks decreased from 1,228 on March 18 to 869 on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\u2014 CDC:         Those fully  vaccinated can travel again in U.S.\u2014 UK bans travel from 4         more nations over virus; 39 in all\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u2014\u2014\u2014SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California on Friday cleared the way for people to attend indoor concerts, theater performances and NBA games for the first time in more than a year as the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus in the state nears a record low.State officials won\u2019t require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events, but they do limit the number of people allowed to attend. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don\u2019t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances.The rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination.\u201cAllowing some of these activities and opportunities to vaccinated individuals is an incentive,\u201d said Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development. \u201cIf they can return to some of their favorite activities because they\u2019re vaccinated then hopefully a few more people will go and get vaccinated.\u201dThe new rules seem to nudge California toward a system of vaccine verification, a hotly debated issue across the country. New York has launched a digital pass residents can use to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test that is accepted at major entertainment venues. But Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Friday banning businesses from requiring so-called \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Despite promises from Gov. Gavin Newsom to build an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers to contain the coronavirus pandemic, a new audit says California mustered less than half of the number promised.But even if the staffing goals were met, it would not have been enough. The intended number of contact tracers was based on an assumption that California would average 5,000 new coronavirus infections a day. But the nation\u2019s most populated state averaged 25,000 per day from late November to the end of December.\u201cThe sheer number of cases has overwhelmed local  jurisdictions\u2019 contact tracing efforts,\u201d State Auditor Elaine Howle wrote in the report released Thursday.Public  officials say one of the best ways to slow the spread of a dangerous disease is to contact infected people and retrace their steps. The goal is to identify others who have been exposed, contact them and ask them to quarantine before they can spread the virus to others.Contact tracing was central to California\u2019s strategy early in the pandemic. The Department of Public Health estimated the state needed 31,400 contact tracers. Newsom pledged to train 10,000 state workers and deploy them to help local public health departments meet that goal.But by January, California had just 12,100 contact tracers, including 2,262 state workers.That month, the state reported 834,000 COVID-19 infections. Local health officials tried to contact 85% of those people, but reached just 40%. Of those they did interview, officials identified others at risk of exposure in just 16% of total cases in January.\u2014\u2014\u2014LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 A 31-year-old Nebraska cattle rancher is recovering after doctors replaced his coronavirus-damaged lungs.The Lincoln Journal-Star reports that Jake Immink, of Fairbury, got sick around Halloween and wound up hospitalized on a ventilator for months. His lungs were so damaged that his only chance for a fairly normal life was a double-lung transplant.He underwent the surgery March 20 after losing weight and building up strength. He put his new lungs to the test this week, walking a mile and a half.\u201cI fully expect him to be herding cattle this summer,\u201d said Dr. Heather Strah, a transplant pulmonologist with Nebraska Medicine in Omaha.Doing transplants for patients whose lungs are damaged by an acute illness is rare, although it has become more common because of COVID-19. Strah said she\u2019s aware of about 40 that have been done since the start of the pandemic, but Immink\u2019s was the first in Nebraska.Immink said he wants to be a cautionary tale to people who may not think COVID-19 is a big deal, and he encouraged everyone to get vaccinated as soon as they can.\u201cI just hope everyone takes it serious and we can get back to a normal life,\u201d he said.\u2014\u2014\u2014OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed nearly a third of Oklahomans have received at least one coronavirus vaccination.Data showed more than 1.26 million people in the state have received at least one dose, about 32% of the state\u2019s nearly 4 million residents. More than 753,000 people have completed their vaccinations.Deputy state health Commissioner Keith Reed said the total number of doses given has topped 2 million.The state had the 22nd highest percentage of the population receiving at least one dose, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The rolling average of new Oklahoma coronavirus cases declined by 27.4% during the past two weeks from 447.3 per day to 324.7, according to the Johns Hopkins data.Totals of 439,149 cases and 7,932 deaths since the pandemic began were reported by the Oklahoma State Department of Health, increases of 372 cases from Thursday and 34 additional deaths. The health department cited CDC death counts in its report.\u2014\u2014\u2014MISSION, Kan. \u2014 Kansas counties already had started dropping or weakening mask rules before lawmakers toppled Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s newly reissued order requiring them. More counties are expected to follow suit.Kelly\u2019s order was similar to one passed in November. It was always porous, allowing the state\u2019s 105 counties to set their own possibly less restrictive rules or opt out of the order entirely.The Democratic governor was required to reissue it Thursday under a new Kansas law. That law also gives eight top legislators the power to reject her efforts to set rules to address the pandemic.The lawmakers overturned Kelly\u2019s order hours later on a party-line vote. That left counties that hadn\u2019t set their own rules without mask requirements.\u2014\u2014\u2014The race is on to vaccinate as many Americans as possible against COVID-19, but a significant number of people in the U.S. are still reluctant to get the shots, even in places where they are plentiful. That\u2019s according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.The poll reports that 25% of Americans say they probably or definitely will not get vaccinated.The holdouts are leery about possible side effects. They tend to be Republican, and they are usually younger and less susceptible to becoming critically ill or dying if they catch COVID-19.There\u2019s been a slight shift, though, since the first weeks of the nation\u2019s largest-ever vaccination campaign, which began in mid-December. An AP-NORC poll conducted in late January showed that 67% of adult Americans were willing to get vaccinated or had already received at least one shot. Now that figure has climbed to 75%.\u2014\u2014\u2014PHOENIX \u2014 The governor of Arizona is demanding that Phoenix drop plans to close parking lots and grills at city parks on Easter weekend.Gov. Doug Ducey blasted Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego for the move, escalating a long-simmering fight between the Republican governor and Democratic mayor.The city says parks are open but parking is restricted to discourage large gatherings that can lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. Ducey says the decision will only drive gatherings indoors where virus transmission is more likely.The governor\u2019s comments come as Arizona reports the largest daily increase in confirmed COVID-19 infections in three weeks with 940 additional cases along with 12 more deaths.\u2014\u2014\u2014PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Oregon\u2019s top public health official says the governor needs to \u201cstart raising a ruckus\u201d over what he sees as an unfair supply of the COVID-19 vaccine sent to Oregon by the federal government compared to other states.Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen said in a letter to Gov. Kate Brown that if Oregon received the same amount of vaccine doses per capita as California, Oregon could have vaccinated an additional 150,000 residents by now.He says if Oregon got as much vaccine as Kansas, that number rises to 227,000 additional Oregonians vaccinated.Oregon ranks 39th in doses administered.\u2014\u2014\u2014BELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Serbia has received the first shipment of vaccines via the international COVAX mechanism.International and the officials from the Serbian government welcomed at the Belgrade airport the delivery of 57,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines.Serbia has separately acquired vaccines primarily China\u2019s Sinopharm and also Pfizer-BioNTech, Russia\u2019s Sputnik V and AstraZeneca. The country of 7 million so far has vaccinated some 1.5 million people with at least one dose.Authorities also proposed to allow bars and restaurants to serve guests outside and stay open longer from next week, although nearly 5,000 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and 39 people died.Serbian doctors have repeatedly called for tougher measures warning that the system is highly-strung, but the government argues that lockdown is hurting the economy.\u2014\u2014\u2014ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistani authorities announced to start walk-in vaccination of people who are 65-year-old or above amid a spike in fatalities and confirmed cases from coronavirus.The older people can just walk in to designated medical facilities to get vaccination, according to the country\u2019s National Command and Control Center which oversees Pakistan\u2019s response to COVID-19.The announcement comes after Pakistan imported 1 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China, the first purchase that comes after initial donations. Pakistan is currently in the middle of the third wave of coronavirus.Pakistan on Friday reported over 5,000 new cases in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day infection rate since June 2020.Pakistan has reported a total of 678,165 infection cases and 14,613 deaths from coronavirus since last year.\u2014\u2014\u2014CAMDEN, Ala. \u2014 Residents 16 and older will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations in Alabama on Monday, expanding an immunization program that ranks last in the nation.Gov. Kay Ivey, who made the announcement Friday after touring a National Guard vaccine clinic in her home county of Wilcox, called the vaccine against the coronavirus \u201cour ticket back to normal.\u201dThe expansion of the vaccines means about 4 million of the state\u2019s 4.9 million residents will be eligible for shots.The state is currently receiving 115,000 first doses weekly, according to the governor\u2019s office. More than 1.1 million people have received at least one vaccine dose in Alabama, and more than 660,000 are fully vaccinated.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics indicate Alabama is last in the nation for one-shot vaccinations (24.7%), with neighboring Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee only slightly better.More than 10,600 people have died from the coronavirus in Alabama, which has reported 516,000 cases.\u2014\u2014\u2014PHOENIX \u2014 Arizona health officials are preparing to move the state\u2019s largest COVID-19 vaccination site indoors as temperatures rise.Gov. Doug Ducey says the site will move April 23 from the parking lot of the NFL\u2019s Arizona Cardinals stadium in Glendale to the air-conditioned interior of the nearby NHL\u2019s Arizona Coyotes arena. It will stop its current 24-hour-a-day operations and run from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.Ducey made the announcement as the state reported its largest daily increase in confirmed cases in three weeks with 940 infections and 12 more deaths.\u2014\u2014\u2014TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof that they\u2019ve been vaccinated to get service.The Republican governor had previously announced his intent to issue an order banning so-called \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d His action also barred any government agency in Florida from issuing such documentation for the purpose of providing proof of vaccinations.In his executive order, DeSantis asserts \u201cvaccination passports reduce individual freedom and will harm patient privacy.\u201dThe order doesn\u2019t preclude businesses, such as restaurants and retail stores, from screening protocols and other measures recommended by state and federal health officials.Florida has reported more than 2 million cases and nearly 33,500 confirmed deaths.\u2014\u2014\u2014ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey reported 42,308 coronavirus cases on Friday, a single-day record for infections.The new infections pushed the total number of cases to 3.4 million.This week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government reinstated weekend lockdown in most of Turkey\u2019s provinces. He also announced restrictions over the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, amid a new surge of infections in the country.About 75% of the infections have been traced to the more contagious variant first identified in Britain, according to the health ministry.Turkey\u2019s overall confirmed death toll rose to 31,892, with 179 deaths reported in the past 24 hours."}
