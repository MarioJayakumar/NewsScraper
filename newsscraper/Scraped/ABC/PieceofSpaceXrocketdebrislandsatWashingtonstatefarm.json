No one was hurt, he said.The National Weather Service in Seattle has said the widely reported bright objects in the sky on March 25 were remnants of the second stage of the  Falcon 9 rocket leaving comet-like trails as they burned up upon reentry to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.The farmer, who authorities said didn't want to be identified, suspected the debris may have come from the rocket and left a message with the sheriff\u2019s office over the weekend, Foreman said. Deputies responded Monday and contacted  officials. SpaceX confirmed it was part of the rocket and has since retrieved it, Foreman said.The Falcon 9 is a reusable two-stage rocket designed by SpaceX to transport people and payloads into the Earth\u2019s orbit and beyond, according to the SpaceX         website. It says there have been 111 launches and 71 landings."}
