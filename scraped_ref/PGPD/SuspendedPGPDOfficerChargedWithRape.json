Police Officer First Class Ryan Macklin was\ntaken into custody this evening. He is accused of sexually assaulting an adult\nfemale driver during a recent traffic stop.\n\n\n\nThe preliminary\ninvestigation reveals Macklin pulled over the driver early Thursday morning on\nUniversity Boulevard in Langley Park. During that stop, Macklin is accused of\nforcing the victim to perform a sexual act while they were both seated in her\ncar in a nearby parking lot. Macklin was on-duty, in uniform,\nand driving a marked police cruiser at the time. At\nthis point in the investigation, there is no evidence as to why he targeted\nthis victim.
