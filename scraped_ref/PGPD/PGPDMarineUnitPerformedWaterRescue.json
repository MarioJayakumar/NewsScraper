The officers raced into help while notifying area public\nsafety agencies \u00a0of the unfolding emergency. \u00a0 As the crew arrived at\nthe bridge, they positioned their boat directly underneath three workers who\nwere dangling off the bridge in a construction bucket and were trapped.\u00a0The\nconditions were dangerous with thick smoke and fire consuming an accident scene\njust above the trapped men. \u00a0Diesel fuel was spilling down, but our marine\nboat had to stay locked in position in case any of the workers fell.\n\u00a0Fairfax Fire Department personnel on the bridge helped to lower each of\nthe construction workers down to our officers on the boat below and our crew\ngot the men to safety one-by-one. \u00a0PGPD\nSergeant Charles Perry said, \u201cThese officers did an outstanding job! \u00a0They\nsaw danger and rushed right to it. At one point the diesel fuel was on fire as\nit was falling down on the officers. \u00a0 We have taken the marine unit boat\nout of service because it is now covered in fuel. \u00a0We couldn\u2019t be more\nproud of their quick actions this morning.\u201d\u00a0\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2018/06/pgpd-marine-unit-performed-water-rescue.html", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2018"}
