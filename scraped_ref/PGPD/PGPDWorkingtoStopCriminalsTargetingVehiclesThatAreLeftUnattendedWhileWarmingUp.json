So far in 2018, we have had 37 vehicles\nreported stolen while being warmed up.\u00a0The weather has been especially\ncold so far this year.\u00a0We are watching this issue develop in real-time and\nwant to partner with our community to stop this type of theft from occurring,\nbecause there will be more cold days ahead.\u00a0This is a 100% preventable\ncrime.\u00a0The message is \u201cWarm up your car.\u00a0 Stay in your car.\u00a0\nKeep your car.\u201d \u201cThe Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\nhas made arrests in several of these thefts, but we want to stop them from\noccurring to begin with. We are urging residents to please stay with their\nvehicles when they are warming up. Even if you just want to run inside for a\nshort period of time, it\u2019s not worth losing your car.\u201d said Captain Ken Humble\nof the PGPD Special Investigation Division. \nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2018/01/pgpd-working-to-stop-criminals.html", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2018"}
