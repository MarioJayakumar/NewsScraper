A perimeter was immediately established. Officers yelled to the\nsuspect to come out of the business with his hands up and surrender. An\nofficer\u00a0observed that the suspect was holding a\u00a0possible\u00a0weapon\nand alerted other officers on scene. The suspect exited a side door with\nthe weapon in his hand and pointed it at least two officers. Officers\nordered the suspect to drop the weapon. One of the officers who was just\nyards away, discharged his duty weapon, striking the suspect one time in his leg. Officers administered first aid on the suspect using their\ndepartment-issued trauma kits. The suspect later died of his injury at\nthe hospital. No officers were hurt.\n\nThis\nphotographed weapon was recovered next to the suspect. Evidence\ntechnicians also recovered a spent shell casing from that gun at the scene.
