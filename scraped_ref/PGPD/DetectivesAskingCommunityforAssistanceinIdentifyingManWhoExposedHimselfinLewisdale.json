This occurred inside of a store in Lewisdale\nSaturday evening. Investigators plan to conduct a canvass today in an attempt\nto gather additional information.On April 21,\nat approximately 7:30 pm, patrol officers were called to the business in the\n2200 block of University Boulevard East. The preliminary\ninvestigation reveals a mother and her daughter had been shopping together. It\nappears while the mother was briefly facing away, the suspect exposed and\ntouched himself in the view of the daughter.\u00a0The suspect did not touch the\nyoung girl. The suspect is\ndescribed as a Hispanic male with a beard. He wore blue jeans, a black and gray\nhat and gray shoes. The canvass will begin at 5:00 pm in the 2200 block of\nUniversity Boulevard East. Detectives are looking\ninto whether a suspicious person report alleging a man exposed himself to a\nchild in early March at the same store is related to this case. At that time,\nofficers reviewed surveillance video and conducted a neighborhood canvass. A potential\nsuspect was not identified nor captured on video. Anyone with information\nthat could help detectives is asked to please call\nour Sexual Assault Unit at 301-772-4908.
