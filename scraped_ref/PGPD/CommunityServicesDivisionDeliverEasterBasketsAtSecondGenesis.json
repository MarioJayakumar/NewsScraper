{"title": "\nCommunity Services Division Deliver Easter Baskets At Second Genesis\n", "body": "\n\n\nOn Thursday, April 1, 2010, Community Services Division had the privilege to present easter baskets to the children of recovering addicts receiving treatment at the Second Genesis Residential Treatment Facility in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Easter baskets were given to 16 children aged infant to 10 years old. While the children were pretty excited that police officers had come to visit them, they were more excited to get the goodies in the baskets! Smiles were on every face as each child grabbed a basket and chirped \"thank you\" rummaging through the baskets.Second Genesis was adopted by the District II COPS-D squad in the fall of 2009.\u00a0 It was the goal of COPS to not just show up for holidays and picture-worthy events, but to show up just because. In the five months that the COPS-D squad has been working with the facility, they have seen children and their mothers come and go, but the one thing that \u00a0has remained consistent is the appreciation that they have when the officers come to the facility just to spend time with them.\u00a0 In December, COPS-D was able to collect 650+ toys through its Operation Pillowcase program and we were able to give Christmas to 26 children who would otherwise, received nothing. Since then, the officers of COPS-D have made visits to spend time with the women and children, donated books, toys, infant and toddler clothes.\u00a0There is a need not only for the physical, material items...but there is also a need for these women and children to know that someone truly does care about them.\u00a0\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2010/04/community-services-division-deliver.html", "date": "Saturday, April 3, 2010"}
