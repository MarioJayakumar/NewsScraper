In a show of our unwavering support to those\naffected by breast cancer, Prince George\u2019s County Police Officers are proudly\nwearing pink badges to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Our officers\npurchased more than 500 of the badges, helping raise more than $2,500 for Susan\nG. Komen Maryland.\u00a0One\nof our officers, Sergeant Sonya Lancaster, is a breast cancer survivor. Please\ntake a moment to hear her thoughts on the PGPD badges and the effort to raise\nawareness and funding for those impacted by this disease. We thank Sergeant\nLancaster for bravely sharing her story. On\nFriday, Chief Hank Stawinski will present a check for the money raised by the\nsale of the pink badges to a representative of Susan G. Komen Maryland. The\npresentation will take place at 11:00 am at the \u201cChief on the Go\u201d event at the\nNational Harbor. We hope residents across the county join us on Friday.\u00a0\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2017/10/officers-proudly-wearing-badges-marking.html", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2017"}
