{"title": "\nTips For Staying Safe This Halloween\n", "body": "It\u2019s Trick-or-Treat time!\u00a0 To help parents and children in our community have an enjoyable Halloween, we offer the following safety tips:Wear a costume that makes it easy for you to walk in and to be seen in.An adult should always accompany smaller children.Older children should travel in groups.Know the route your child intends to take, and set a time that they should return home.Carry a flashlight and make sure that some sort of reflective material is incorporated into the costume.Utilize sidewalks when available and try to stay in well-lit areas. Never dart out between parked cars. Always cross at corners and crosswalks.An outside light on front of a house is usually a sign that trick-or-treaters are welcome. Avoid going to houses that are not lit.Drive slowly! Be aware that young trick-or-treaters may dart out from between parked cars.Do not drive a vehicle while wearing a mask of any sort. Your visibility could be obscured.Stop at all crosswalks.We hope your Halloween is both enjoyable and safe.For more information, please contact the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Media Relations Division at 301-772-4710.\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2017/10/tips-for-staying-safe-this-halloween.html", "date": "Thursday, October 19, 2017"}
