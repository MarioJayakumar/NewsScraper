{"title": "\nPGPD WELCOMES INTERNATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERSHIP TO HEADQUARTERS  \n", "body": "The\nPrince George's County Police Department was proud to host leadership from\nMexico, Central America, and South America today.\u00a0\n\nPGPD command staff and members from investigative units from across our agency\nmet with our visiting law enforcement partners about attacking transnational\ncrime. Much of the focus was on engaging with criminal leadership abroad\nas key to protecting county streets and disrupting criminal activity at\nhome. Also, in attendance, was Maryland Deputy Secretary of State Louis\nBorunda who remarked on the criticality of these partnerships.\u00a0 Since\nassuming command in January, 2016, PGPD Chief Hank Stawinski has worked to\nbuild relationships with police officials in Latin America in his effort to\ncombat transnational crime. Today's invaluable exchange of\ninformation was an extension of that continuing work and follows separate trips\nby Chief Stawinski and PGPD Assistant Chief Hector Velez to El Salvador.\n\n\"Today, on behalf of our community, we had the opportunity to have\nconversations with the attaches of several countries challenged by\ntransnational crime.\u00a0 We look forward to collaborating with their police\nagencies and providing critical information. \u00a0We will benefit from\nreceiving information from them so that we, in a concerted way, can make a\ndifference in our community and in their communities when it comes to fighting\ntransnational crime,\" said Chief Stawinski.\nFor a video snapshot of today\u2019s\nmeeting click on this link:\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2018/06/pgpd-welcomes-international-law.html", "date": "Tuesday, June 26, 2018"}
