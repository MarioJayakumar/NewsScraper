While purple is the designated color for domestic violence awareness campaigns, purple beams of light don\u2019t show as well in the night sky, so we are using massive white searchlights as we \u201cShine the Spotlight on Domestic Violence.\u201dThe spotlights will illuminate after sunset\u00a0\u00a0and will be seen\u00a0.Please click on the two videos we shared with our community as we work to inform our residents about the spotlights, and more importantly, why we are doing this. Please feel free to share on your social media platforms.\u00a0We are also extremely happy to announce that National Harbor and Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center are joining us in our event\u00a0. National Harbor will light the Capital Wheel purple and the Gaylord National Resort and Convention will light their towers purple as we all shine the light on domestic violence.\u00a0 \u00a0This is all in concert with the Prince George\u2019s County Sheriff's Office which is lighting the County Administration Building purple\u00a0.This is truly a countywide effort to bring hope to the victims of domestic violence and to put the perpetrators of such on notice that we will shine a light on their crimes. \u00a0\u00a0Any questions or request for interviews Monday, please contact the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Media Relations Division at\u00a0\u00a0or Media Relations Division Director Jennifer Donelan at\u00a0. \u00a0\nPosted by\n\n\nPrince George's County Police\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2017/10/prince-georges-county-police-shine.html", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2017"}
