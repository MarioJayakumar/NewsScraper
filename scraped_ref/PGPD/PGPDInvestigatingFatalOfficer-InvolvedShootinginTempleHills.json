As requested, officers responded and saw a man\nmatching the description given by the caller. As one patrol officer attempted\nto speak to the suspect, the suspect ran across the street to Brinkley Road and\nwas seen entering an apartment building.\u00a0While he was running, the suspect\ntossed two license plates he had stolen earlier.\u00a0\u00a0Officers found the\nsuspect hiding in a laundry room and gave him repeated verbal commands to\nsurrender but he did not comply. The officers and the suspect then began to\nstruggle. One officer attempted to use a taser on the suspect, but it did not\ntake effect. The suspect then produced a handgun from his waistband. One of the\nofficers managed to get his hand on the suspect\u2019s gun in an attempt to prevent\nhim from pointing it at any of the officers. The suspect fired his gun.\n\u00a0Based on initial forensic analysis of the suspect\u2019s gun, the involved\nofficers\u2019 guns, and additional video evidence,\u00a0we have now\nlearned\u00a0that the suspect fired\u00a0his\u00a0weapon twice. One of the\nofficers returned fire one time, striking the suspect. \u00a0Jose Alvarez was\npronounced dead at the scene. The officer who grabbed the gun did suffer an\ninjury to his hand when the suspect discharged his weapon. The suspect\u2019s gun\nwas recovered in the laundry room. It is pictured below.A resident in the apartment complex recorded the\npolice presence outside of her building moments before the shooting took place.\nThe resident\u2019s cell phone recording captures the sounds of the three gunshots.Regarding the two prior\nshootings to which she refers in the video, one allegedly occurred two weeks\nago when a witness says a male fired a gun towards a female. \u00a0That was not\nreported to police until today. \u00a0 Detectives are working to verify the\nincident. \u00a0The second case happened yesterday and involved a group of\nmales in a car shooting another car. \u00a0 No one was injured. \u00a0 Our\nofficers were called, responded to the area, and recovered a shell casing at\nthe scene. \u00a0The earlier reported non-contact shooting and the vandalism by\ngunfire cases are being handled by our Regional Investigation Detectives.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe involved officer in this morning\u2019s incident is now on administrative leave\npending the outcome of the investigation which is standard procedure. \u00a0\nThe\u00a0Prince\nGeorge\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reviews all officer-involved\nshootings.\u00a0If anyone has information in this investigation, they are asked to please call\ndetectives\u00a0at\u00a0301-856-2660.
