A member of the\ncommunity had provided information about a suspect who was selling drugs and\noften carried a handgun. The preliminary investigation reveals the officers\nobserved a man matching the suspect\u2019s description and attempted to approach\nhim. The officers gave verbal commands for the man to stop and show his hands.\nInstead, the suspect, Campfield, began to run away. Two officers chased after\nhim on foot. One of the officers caught up to Campfield and took him to the\nground. The officer observed that the suspect had a weapon and yelled to fellow\nofficers that the suspect was armed with a handgun. A second officer on the\nscene witnessed the struggle and observed the suspect holding the gun. At that\ntime, the officer struggling with the suspect discharged his duty weapon,\nstriking the suspect. That officer then immediately began providing medical aid\nto the suspect until an ambulance arrived. Campfield died several hours later\nat a hospital. The suspect\u2019s gun was recovered on the scene.\u00a0The involved officer is Corporal Jeffrey Benson of the Special\nOperations Division\u2019s Emergency Services Team. He joined the PGPD in 2006.\u00a0The\ninvolved officer is now on administrative leave pending the outcome of the\ninvestigation.\u00a0The Prince George\u2019s\nCounty State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reviews all officer-involved shootings.\u00a0If anyone has information in this investigation, they are\nasked to please call detectives\u00a0at\u00a0301-856-2660.
