Unfortunately, I'm there now. Didn't have a choice.\u201dCreating a new farm costs money, as does maintaining an established one. Many farmers require loans to operate, and for many Black farmers, the federal Department of Agriculture loans they need to survive have been fraught with discriminatory lending practices.\u201cI lost my original 46-acre track of land, and it was through the act of discrimination,\u201d said John Boyd, founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association.Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer, has been working to shine a light on the decades of mistreatment of Black farmers.\u201cWhen it takes on average 387 days to process a Black loan request and less than 30 days to process a white farmer\u2019s loan request, it's hard to compete,\u201d Boyd said.At the turn of the century, there were more than 1 million black farmers with some 20 million acres of land, representing 14% of the nation\u2019s farmers. Now, they represent 1.5%.\u201cIt's hard to buy another farm,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cIt's hard to replace the history that comes along, the wealth of history that comes along with that family farm where you siblings were raised there and your parents and grandparents. It's very painful.\u201dBoyd helped get that $5 billion in COVID-19 relief money for farmers of color.\u201cI believe it's a step in the right direction,\u201d Boyd said.The hope is Black farmers actually get the money they desperately need to survive.\u201cWe have the folks at the federal level, they\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to give you all this money,\u2019 but they\u2019re not the ones that\u2019s actually sitting behind a desk that's then distributing those funds,\u201d Livingstone said.Discriminatory lending practices have cost Black farmers some 12 million acres, mostly since the 1950s. The hope is that this money from the federal government will help to make some of that right.Boyd said he's working with U.S. senators on a bill called Justice for Black Farmers, which calls for Black farmers who lost farms to unfair lending practices to get that land back.COVID-19 Vaccination in Your State and CountyThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports daily numbers on the percent of people fully vaccinated based on a person's county of residence.Source: The .
