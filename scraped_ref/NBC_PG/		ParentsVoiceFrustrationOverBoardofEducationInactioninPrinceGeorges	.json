{"title": "\n\t\tParents Voice Frustration Over Board of Education Inaction in Prince George's\t", "body": "The Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education held its first meeting since the board chair halted them over what she said were ethics concerns about\u00a0contracts.\u00a0The meeting\u2019s Zoom format did not blunt the outrage of parents, and others, at the time lost during which they would have liked to see Board of Education Chair Juanita Miller \u2014 appointed by County Executive Angela Alsobrooks in January \u2014 convene meetings to vote on issues of concern to the community.\u201cMadam chair, your decision to suspend the Feb. 11 board meeting over a contract dispute disappoints and irritates me to no end,\u201d parent Gerrod Tyler said. \u201cThis foolishness has to stop now. If you are unable to conduct yourself accordingly going forward, I strongly suggest that you resign from this post effective immediately because we simply don\u2019t have the time for these shenanigans.\u201dSuperintendent Dr. Monica Goldson outlined her plan, unveiled last week, to begin returning students to classroom learning.\u00a0Emerson Tiwang, a student at Charles Flowers High School, warned the plan may need even more resources given\u00a0the mental health toll that months of distance learning has taken.\u201cThe students have stated they wish to see the hiring of more counselors on return back to school that are trained to deal with mental health,\u201d he said.Local mayors also expressed displeasure with the board\u2019s inactivity in a letter to the county executive.\u201cI think the next step has to be some type of relationship building or a leeway so that the chair and the school board representatives can come to a meeting of the minds,\u201d Fairmount Heights Mayor Lillie Martin said.In a statement on the matter, Alsobrooks said, \u201cThe focus of our Board of Education should be squarely on our students, teachers and their parents.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-school-board-meeting-since-chair-stopped-them-over-ethics-concerns/2587700/", "date": null}
