{"title": "\n\t\tMaryland Health Officials Urge Reluctant First Responders to Get COVID-19 Vaccine\t", "body": "In parts of Maryland, local health officials are working to convince reluctant first responders to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0That reluctance could slow down the process of distributing the shot to other groups still waiting for theirs.\u00a0One such first responder is Heather Dautrich, who for 14 years has been a volunteer EMT for the Waldorf Fire Department.\u00a0She saves the lives of others, but doubted the coronavirus vaccine could save hers at first.\u201cI was actually very hesitant because I just did not fully trust the vaccine,\u201d Dautrich said.\u00a0After she saw her vaccinated colleagues recover just fine, she gave it a second thought.\u201cI just felt that my health, my mom's health, my son's health was more important than the little bit of reservation I was still having,\u201d\u00a0 Dautrich said.\u00a0Charles County Health Officer Dr. Dianna E. Abney said the county has used about 94% of the vaccines they have, but only 50% of eligible medical frontline workers and first responders have opted to get it.\u201cMedical professionals are humans and they are just like the regular public,\u201d Abney said. \u201cIf I could speak to them personally, I\u2019d say this is a safe vaccine. It helps you and it helps your patients for you to be vaccinated.\u201dLa Plata Police Chief Carl Schinner got his vaccination Wednesday after seeing the way the coronavirus hit his own officers.\u201cOur department had a third of the officers affected by Covid at one time. We had one officer who spent 10 days in intensive care, so we got to see first hand how dangerous this disease is,\u201d Schinner said.\u00a0\u00a0In Prince George's County, a lack of vaccinators got the county's efforts off to a slow start. They still have half of the 3,700 vaccines they received from the state nearly four weeks ago.\u00a0I just felt that my health, my mom's health, my son's health was more important than the little bit of reservation I was still having.Hesitancy is also impacting the numbers.\u00a0\u201cWe're finding that about 30% of each area in 1a wants the vaccine right away, and then we're getting callbacks from folks who say, \u2018Yeah I\u2019ve changed my mind, let\u2019s get on the list,\u2019\u201d Diane Young,the associate director of the Prince George\u2019s County Health Department, said.\u00a0School nurses and the national guard are helping to move the process along, but qualified people need to sign up for the shot.\u00a0\u201cIf you are in 1a you have an opportunity to make a difference today,\u201d Young said.\u00a0However, there is some good news. Prince George\u2019s County officials initially thought that they were not going to be able to move out of group 1a and into 1b until mid-February. Now, they say they may be able to get it done as early as the end of January.\u00a0The county is distributing vaccinations at the Sports and Learning Complex in Landover, and plan to open additional vaccine centers soon.\u00a0For more details on the county's vaccination process and to find out when it's your turn, visit .", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/maryland-health-officials-urge-reluctant-first-responders-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/2541309/", "date": null}
