{"title": "\n\t\tMan Sentenced to Life in Prison for Murder of Bowie State Student on UMD Campus\t", "body": "A white man was sentenced Thursday to life in prison for stabbing a Black college student to death on the University of Maryland's campus in what prosecutors say was a racially motivated crime.Richard Collins III was days away from graduating from Bowie State University and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army when he was killed in May 2017. He was 23.\u00a0Collins was waiting at a University of Maryland bus stop when Sean Urbanski walked up, told him to \"step left,\" then stabbed him in the chest.\u00a0In December 2019, a Prince George\u2019s County jury convicted Urbanski, now 25, of first-degree murder.\u00a0Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Aisha Braveboy said in a statement that Urbanski was a member of a racist social media group and singled Collins out for the attack at a bus stop.\u00a0Prosecutors have said that a mixture of alcohol and racist propaganda motivated Urbanski to act on a hatred for Black people.Defense attorney John McKenna said in court that his client was drunk and there was no evidence or testimony to support a racial motive for the killing.A judge dismissed a hate crime charge against Urbanski before jurors began deliberating, ruling that prosecutors didn't meet their legal burden of showing that racial hatred motivated Urbanski to stab Collins.In a law named for Collins, Maryland recently strengthened its hate crime law so prosecutors don\u2019t have to prove hate was the only motivating factor in committing a crime.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/man-to-be-sentenced-for-murder-of-bowie-state-student-on-umd-campus/2535827/", "date": null}
