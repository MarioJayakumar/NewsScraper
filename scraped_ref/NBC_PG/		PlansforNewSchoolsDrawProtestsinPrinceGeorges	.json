It's part of the county's more than $1 billion public-private partnership plan to build six news schools.\u201cWe just weren't included, and our input wasn't asked for on what we felt about having a school here,\u201d said Ron Weiss of the Tantallon Citizens Association.Details of the rapidly moving construction plan are spawning protests, especially after parents were told some schools would be temporarily relocated during construction.\u201cI understand their concerns about this operation that is going to occur, but we\u2019re talking about a temporary uncomfortableness,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County School Board Vice Chair Sonya Williams said.Williams said the school system will advocate for water mitigation along with construction. She said her focus is on students.\u201cWe have schools that are so old we have to come in and mitigate mold every over months,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have issues with schools that are crumbling around us. If we do nothing, then nothing will change.\u201dNeighbors said they'd prefer the school system rebuild a nearby school instead of breaking ground on a new one.The leaders of these community organizations will meet with the school board vice chair Sunday and the county executive in April.The school system has a plan to clear trees to construct the new school this summer.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/plans-for-new-schools-draw-protests-in-prince-georges/2620304/", "date": null}
