{"title": "\n\t\tHomicides Nearly Triple Last Year's Numbers in Prince George's County Amid Violent Weekend\t", "body": "Prince George's County Police are investigating four separate homicides after a violent weekend, leaving residents asking for a reason for the tragic trend. Sixteen people have been killed in the county this January, which is nearly triple compared to last year. \u201cIt\u2019s just unusual for our neighborhood,\u201d one man, who did not want his face shown on camera, said.\u00a0He said he heard \u201cat least 10 or 12\u201d gunshots that killed his neighbor, 48-year-old Sharone Redding.\u00a0Police said Redding, who was a Metro employee, was killed when someone fired shots into her Upper Marlboro home in the 12800 block of Dunkirk Drive.\u00a0\u201cWe believe that somebody targeted that house in particular. Do we believe our victim was the intended target? We\u2019re still working through that, but there is a chance that she was not,\u201d Major Brian Reilly, the commander of the Criminal Investigation Division, said.\u00a0On Friday in Riverdale, 32-year-old Shauntese Gedeon of Riverdale was shot multiple times and killed in a parking lot in the 5300 block of Hamilton Street.Overwhelmingly, people know each other, an argument takes place, somebody pulls out a gun and then there\u2019s a shooting. That same night, 21-year-old Nakia Stewart of D.C. was driven to an area hospital after he had been shot and killed in a parking lot in the 2600 block of Shadyside Avenue in Suitland.\u00a0Sunday afternoon in Temple Hills, two men were shot. One was killed in the 4500 block of Dallas Place.Investigators are still sorting out what led to all of these shootings, and police said that while none of these cases are connected, there is a theme.\u201cOverwhelmingly, people know each other, an argument takes place, somebody pulls out a gun and then there\u2019s a shooting,\u201d Reilly said.\u00a0So far, police said they have closed 10 of those previously mentioned homicide cases and have promising leads for the murders that happened this past weekend.\u201cWe are reallocating our resources, our patrol officers, our marked units, our undercover officers, our intelligence officers and units, and we are moving them into the spots that we believe are going to be the most effective in preventing these types of crimes in the first place,\u201d Reilly said.\u00a0Prince George's County Police are also offering up to $25,000 for information that can help to lead to an arrest and indictment in the murders.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/homicides-nearly-triple-last-years-numbers-in-prince-georges-county-amid-violent-weekend/2558219/", "date": null}
