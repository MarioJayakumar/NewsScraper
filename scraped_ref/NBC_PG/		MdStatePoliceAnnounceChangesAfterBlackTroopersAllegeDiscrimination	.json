Jerry Jones presented his solutions for improving his department in a meeting of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus attended by House Speaker Adrienne Jones.\u201cI\u2019m committed to working with you to bring clarity to the concern and take the appropriate steps to resolve these issues together,\u201d Jones said.In February, News4 reported that while Black troopers make up less than 12% of the overall department, they are disciplined at a higher rate than white troopers, especially last year.The superintendent announced changes to the board that disciplines officers.\u201cAny lack of confidence must be handled immediately and in order to do, so I am making changes in the Office of Fair Practices,\u201d Jones said.Other changes include:\u201cI appreciate the colonel's efforts,\u201d said Del. Darryl Barnes, chairman of the Black Caucus. \u201cI believe his intentions are pure, but I do know that there is a lot of work that needs to be done.\u201d\u201cWhat we're hearing from the colonel is one thing, and what we are hearing from the Black troopers is another,\u201d Del. Joanne Benson said.A Black trooper who wished to remain anonymous to protect his job said he does not believe it\u2019s a good first step because it does not address immediate concerns.\u201cThe key concern for us immediately right now is discipline and the culture, and we have not seen any plans to fix that,\u201d the trooper said.After News4\u2019s report, an internal memo detailing a new crime initiative surfaced from the Waldorf barrack. It was called \u201cMake Waldorf Great Again,\u201d a political reference that offended some Black officers.\u201cThere needs to be a change,\u201d the trooper said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the colonel for him to be that change. Be that change.\u201d The Maryland Legislative Black Caucus is working to organize a meeting between Black troopers and the superintendent for the Maryland State Police Department.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/md-state-police-announce-changes-after-black-troopers-allege-discrimination/2635893/", "date": null}
