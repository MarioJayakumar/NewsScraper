{"title": "\n\t\tLegislation Would Encourage New Prince George's Grocery Stores by Allowing Beer, Wine Sales\t", "body": "New legislation proposed in Maryland is intended to lure more grocery stores to Prince George's County by promising that they can sell wine and beer.\u00a0The bill aims to address the county's long-standing food desert issue and its oversaturation of liquor stores in some communities.\u00a0\u201cOn average, per census tracking within the inner Beltway, we average three liquor stores per square mile,\u201d Del. Jazz Lewis (D-District 24) said.He is proposing legislation to lure new grocery stores by allowing them to sell wine and beer, possibly breaking up the oversaturation of liquor stores through competition.On average, per census tracking within the inner Beltway, we average three liquor stores per square mile.\u201cWe have complete oversight over our liquor laws, so we are using our power to drive these grocery stores where they are needed most,\u201d Lewis said.Under the proposed legislation, small liquor stores that don't want to compete with supermarkets selling beer and wine can relocate to other parts of the county, which they were not allowed to do before, Lewis said.\u201cWe've had a law on the books for the last 30 years, where they were landlocked into a certain legislative district,\u201d he said.In Landover, there are two liquor stores side by side, sharing one parking lot. Meanwhile, a grocery store across the street closed. When that happens in communities of color, change must be intentional, according to University of Maryland Associate Professor of Urban Studies Willow Lung-Amam.\u201cI do think we that need some kind of intervention in the development process because the market, the quote unquote market, does not take care of every community equally,\u201d Lung-Amam said.After years of disinvestment, it sometimes takes legislation and incentives to even the playing field in communities of color.\u201cThe idea that we would intervene and try to provide a mix of uses in every community,\u201d she said. \u201cThat everybody has a neighborhood retailer, that everybody has a grocery store, simply to me makes common sense,\u201d Lung-Amam said.The lobby representing the county's liquor stores is opposed to the bill the and released a statement saying, in part, \u201c\ufeffOn the issue of using beer and wine to solve the \u2018food desert\u2019 issue, the Maryland Public Health Association submitted written testimony this year stating that \u2018there is no research that we are aware of that supports expanding alcohol sales to grocery, chain and convenient stores as an intervention for food insecurity or obesity.\u2019\u201dIf passed, the legislation would not benefit grocery stores that already exist. It would apply to new stores that open in October 2021.The Prince George's County Council and the county executive support passing the legislation in Annapolis.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/legislation-would-encourage-new-grocery-stores-in-prince-georges-by-allowing-sale-of-beer-wine/2599689/", "date": null}
