{"title": "\n\t\tLong Lines for Vaccination at Six Flags Leaves Residents Frustrated\t", "body": "A long wait for Maryland\u2019s mass vaccination site at Six Flags America Friday left frustrations running high and tempers short.The line of cars backed up onto Central Avenue in Bowie for longer than a mile.Some drivers purposefully tried to cut in line, but others were confused.\u201cThere was somebody, and \u2026 nobody was letting her in line, and I wasn\u2019t gracious enough, either,\u201d said Mary Burgett, a Prince George\u2019s County resident who waited almost two hours in line.Officers had to intervene on a few occasions, including an accident that occurred in line.After making it through the line and getting her first dose of the vaccine, Burgett\u2019s frustration subsided \u2014 but she still wasn\u2019t happy about the experience.The vaccinated population in D.C. may be overestimated in this map because some non-residents who work in D.C. are included in the totals.\u201cIf I can get my second vaccination somewhere else, I will,\u201d she said.In a statement to News4, the Maryland Department of Health urged residents to stop cutting in line.\u201cThis is of course a large logistical operation, and we are making daily adjustments to solve problems,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe understand that people are anxious to receive their vaccination, but line cutting slows the entire process and delays eligible citizens from getting vaccinated.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/long-lines-for-vaccination-at-six-flags-leaves-residents-frustrated/2597344/", "date": null}
