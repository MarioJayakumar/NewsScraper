It originated in Maryland in 1974 and quickly spread to police departments across the nation.\u00a0Reforms are long overdue, said State Sen.

They all said they want this conversation to end for people who look like them.\u00a0\u201cI have never heard of this type of press conference or this type of panel happening with a bunch of white people saying, \u2018Hey, I need you to stop killing my husband and I need you to stop killing my wife and my children,\u2019\u201d Nikki Owens said.\u00a0Elliot, whose son was killed by police in 1993, said she still wishes she could have her son back.\u00a0\u201cEven now, sometimes I feel like it\u2019s just a bad dream and my son will just walk through that door,\u201d she said.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/maryland-families-push-for-police-reforms-repeal-of-officers-bill-of-rights/2554146/", "date": null}
