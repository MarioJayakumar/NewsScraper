That\u2019s about 42,000 students.A group of parents, teachers and others organized by PG Change Makers voiced their concerns Thursday at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t gotten better, it\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d Greenbelt Mayor Colin Byrd said.\u201cThis is a problem where parents had the opportunity to chose, and students. But teachers didn\u2019t. They were forced into circumstances, to chose between their livelihood or their life,\u201d said Krystal Oriadha.\u00a0The process of transitioning back to physical classrooms comes after a year of distance learning in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Rally organizers say they believe danger still exists, and that the move back to physical classrooms is happening too fast. They say some teachers are still not fully vaccinated.Theresa Mitchell Dudley, President of the Prince George\u2019s County Education Association, voiced worry about ventilation systems and said there are not enough school nurses to carry out virus testing.Teacher Chrissy Wilkin says kids are getting sick now, and they aren\u2019t vaccinated. Shots are only approved for those over 16.Prince George\u2019s Public Schools CEO Dr. Monica Goldson has previously said that returning students and staff will be met with new COVID-19 protocols including personal protective equipment, improved sanitation and air filtration, as well as robust contact tracing.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-schools-bring-students-back-to-class-despite-some-teachers-concerns/2633691/", "date": null}
