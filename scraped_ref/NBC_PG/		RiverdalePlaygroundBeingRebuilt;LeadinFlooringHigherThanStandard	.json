{"title": "\n\t\tRiverdale Playground Being Rebuilt; Lead in Flooring Higher Than Standard\t", "body": "On a rare, balmy, early March day, one might expect the playground next to Riverdale Elementary School in Maryland to be filled with kids crawling all over the equipment. Instead it\u2019s off-limits and will be for a while.\u201cThe poured in-place rubber matting, that is the concern,\u201d Angel Waldron, spokesperson for Prince George\u2019s County Parks and Recreation, said.\u00a0That material started showing up on playgrounds because it provided a softer surface. When kids take their inevitable falls, it\u2019s a lot better than asphalt.\u00a0However, the material\u2019s lead content, \u201csome higher levels than the EPA standard,\u201d is the problem in this case, according to Waldron.\u00a0It\u2019s a particular part of the surface that authorities are concerned about, not the whole playground. Officials also said the real danger comes if it\u2019s ingested.For the past few months, the county has been testing all of its 54 playgrounds. This was the only one with a lead problem.\u00a0\u201cJust to be sure, we bolted the gates, we put up signage that it's closed for maintenance,\u201d Waldron said.\u00a0\u00a0Many local playgrounds have been closed since early in the pandemic, out of concern about the virus spreading through contact surfaces. That will give the parks and recreation department time to rebuild the playground entirely with a different surface -- wood fiber.The rebuild is expected to take several months.", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/riverdale-playground-being-rebuilt-lead-content-in-flooring-higher-than-epa-standard/2599808/", "date": null}
