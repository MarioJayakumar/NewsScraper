{"title": "Australia man finds snake in lettuce bought at supermarket", "body": "CANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alex White thought he was watching a huge worm writhing in plastic-wrapped lettuce he'd just brought home from a Sydney supermarket \u2014.\u201cI kind of completely freaked out when I saw this little tongue come out of its mouth and start flicking around and realized it was a snake because worms don\u2019t have tongues,\u201d White said on Thursday.It was a venomous pale-headed snake that authorities say made an 870-kilometer (540-mile) journey to Sydney from a packing plant in the Australian city of Toowoomba wrapped in plastic with two heads of cos lettuce.The refrigerated supermarket supply chain likely lulled the cold-blooded juvenile into a stupor until White bought the lettuce at an ALDI supermarket on Monday evening and rode his bicycle home with salad and snake in his backpack.White and his partner Amelia Neate spotted the snake moving as soon as the lettuce was unpacked onto the kitchen table.They also noticed the plastic wrapping was torn and that the snake could escape, so they quickly stuffed the reptile with the lettuce into a plastic food storage container.White phoned the WIRES rescue organization and a snake handler took the snake away that night.Before the handler arrived, White said WIRES had explained to him: \u201cIf you get bitten, you\u2019ve got to go to hospital really quickly.\u201dALDI is investigating how a snake could have found its way into a supermarket.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with the customer and the team at WIRES to identify the snake\u2019s natural habitat, which is certainly not an ALDI store!\u201d the German-based supermarket chain said in a statement.WIRES reptile coordinator Gary Pattinson said while the snake was less than 20 centimeters (8 inches) long, it was \u201cas venomous as it will ever be.\u201dPattinson is caring for the snake until it is returned to Queensland state next week, following the WIRES policy of returning rescued wildlife to where it comes from.\u201cIt\u2019s the first snake I\u2019ve ever had in sealed, packed produce,\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cWe get frogs in them all the time.\u201dNeate, a German immigrant, said her brush with a venomous snake in a Sydney kitchen was a setback in her efforts to assure relatives in Europe that Australia\u2019s notoriously deadly Outback wildlife was nothing to worry about.\u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019m just in the city; it\u2019s totally fine here,\u201d she added.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/australia-man-finds-snake-in-lettuce-bought-at-supermarket", "date": "2021-04-15T12:02:07.000Z"}
