{"title": "'Dream Chasers': When COVID took their football season, these Maryland boys made their own", "body": "The pandemic took from them a sport they loved. Now their passion to play has them celebrating a championship.  They are a group of Charles County, Maryland high school football players who this past weekend hoisted a trophy.Last fall, COVID-19 forced the cancelation of high school sports. When the Charles County public school system decided not to play fall sports during the spring semester, they were devastated. Durrell Gray, father of Dorian, one of the players, says it took a psychological toll as well. So Gray says they found an alternative. With the help of a young coach and former player named Sean Mclaughlin they formed a team of their own to play 7 v. 7 football tournaments. And so the Dream Chasers Elite 7v7 team was born.Gray says the team first went to tournaments in Orlando, Florida and then South Carolina. They did so well they were invited to a tournament in Tampa, Florida. This past weekend, competing in the U-18 division, the Dream Chasers beat out 19 other teams to win the tournament. The win has earned them an invitation to a tournament in Texas.Durrell Gray says the college recruiting process is now back on track for several of the players but, more importantly, they\u2019re happy again. Gray says being away from their sport and friends has taken a toll. The Dream Chasers has given them a way to beat not only their opponents but the pandemic itself.", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/high-school/dream-chasers-covid-football-season-maryland-boys", "date": "2021-03-09T16:14:05.000Z"}
