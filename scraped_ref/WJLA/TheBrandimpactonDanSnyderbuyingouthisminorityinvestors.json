{"title": "The Brand impact on Dan Snyder buying out his minority investors", "body": "Dan Snyder is not going anywhere. In fact, it appears he will be gaining even more control.Washington Football Team owner Dan Snyder will now gain almost complete control of the franchise.The NFL\u2019s finance committee cleared the way for him buying out his minority investors.Snyder recently applied for a $450 million debt waiver, which the finance committee approved.ABC7 sports anchor Scott Abraham spoke with John Ourand of the Sports Business Journal on the impact this will have on the franchise\u201cIt\u2019s the least bit of surprising bit of news that I\u2019ve heard throughout this entire thing. The NFL owners club is a club that is very difficult to get into and it\u2019s also a very difficult club to leave,\u201d Ourand told Abraham. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen an NFL owner get voted out of his ownership by the rest of the owners group.\u201dOnce the deal goes through, Snyder would be buying another 40.5% of shares from minority owners Fred Smith, Robert Rothman and Dwight Schar. Snyder would have to repay the debt by 2028.\u201cI know that Dan Snyder, the fan base, especially after decades of losses is getting fed up with. But the business of the NFL couldn\u2019t be better right now,\u201d Ourand said. \u201cIf Dan Snyder as a brand is nuclear and is hurting the league or the team, I\u2019m not seeing it. The league isn\u2019t seeing it. It\u2019s easy to dislike the owner of a franchise, but it\u2019s not doing anything to financially hurt the team or the league.\u201dThe Washington football franchise has been dealing with a lot of different things over the past year. They are currently in the middle of a long rebrand process. For now, the franchise will be sticking with the Washington Football Team for the upcoming season.\u201cOne of the first questions that friends of mine have texted me, \u201cis the name going to come back?\u201d It\u2019s almost certainly will not. The team has already spent a lot of money to move away from that brand and name,\u201d Ourand said. \u201cThey spent a lot of money promoting the Washington Football Team name and colors. Even if Dan Snyder wants to return to that name, he\u2019s already been told by corporate partners and the NFL, not to do it.\u201dWashington experienced some success last season in Ron Rivera\u2019s first season as head coach. They won the NFC East, hosting a playoff game before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Buccaneers.For this deal to become official, the transaction will be subject to three-fourths approval of 24 of 32 clubs and that vote could come next week when the owners meet.\u201cWill Dan Snyder be able to use some of that media money that\u2019s coming in to pay down the debt that he\u2019s taking, which is a huge amount, over $400 million in debt,\u201d Ourand said. \u201cOr will he try to get some sort of investors that he\u2019s a little bit more comfortable with than the minority partners that are leaving. I don\u2019t know the answer to that, I would expect that he would probably look for other investors. If you\u2019re giving me my story list, that\u2019s at the top of it.\u201d", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-football-team/the-brand-impact-on-dan-snyder-buying-out-his-minority-investors", "date": "2021-03-24T19:57:10.000Z"}
