Now a venture capitalist, he already has a billionaire backer supporting him and, despite previous criticism of Trump, has met with the former president. But other Republicans are hardly clearing the field, and Vance's success is likely to hinge on whether the state's white working-class voters embrace him as a home-state hero or an opportunist.Muterspaw, 52, splashed some almond milk into his dark-roast coffee at Java Johnny\u2019s, among the trendy restaurants and retail shops that have been popping up along Central Avenue \u2014 where there still are some of the \u201cWe Buy Gold\u201d storefronts that sprang up during the Great Recession. Middletown is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Cincinnati.A Republican with mixed feelings about Trump, Muterspaw thinks Vance has the Trump-like ability to connect with GOP voters and a relatable life story.Vance rose out of a family beset by chaos from his mother's addictions; from a mill town that was in steep decline and ravaged by opioids as its major employers faltered amid globalization. He joined the Marines, served in Iraq, worked his way through The Ohio State University and graduated from Yale Law School before heading to Silicon Valley in 2014, then returning to Ohio in 2017.His bestselling book told not only his own story but also highlighted the people of Appalachia and cities like his hometown that feel left behind, and it was embraced by small-government conservatives for depicting poverty as a cultural problem not easily fixed by government programs and aid.He became a popular TV political commentator, dubbed \u201cthe Trump whisperer\u201d for his ability to explain the Republican's rise to the presidency, and his book became a Ron Howard-directed movie.Vance didn't respond to an interview request from The Associated Press. But in interviews and tweets, he's signaled his interest in the culture war issues popular in the GOP.At a forum on \u201cDesegregating Poverty,\" hosted by veteran civil rights activist Robert Woodford, he argued that addressing the problem of fatherless families, regardless of race, and focusing on the kind of stable home life he lacked are crucial to socioeconomic progress.Just before Easter, Vance posted a lengthy essay on his spiritual journey from Christian evangelical roots into atheism and then to becoming Catholic.

Vance didn't provide an explanation publicly, but the Morehead, Kentucky, newspaper linked the resignation to the Carlson tweet and others.Part of the Appalachian code warns against getting \u201ctoo big for your britches.\" Some think Vance has, perpetuating backward regional stereotypes while making his millions in Silicon Valley.In December, Appalachian authors presented a program titled \u201c.\u201dMeanwhile, political foes are skeptical about his motives.Vance is \u201csomeone that, I feel, has purposely used poor people and the people of Appalachia and even his own family to promote his own image.

Tim Ryan, who represents the northeastern part of Appalachian Ohio and is readying a Senate run.Thirty-two of Ohio's 88 counties are classified as Appalachian, with roughly 2 million residents in a state of 11.7 million. However, hundreds of thousands of more people in cities such as Columbus, Dayton and Middletown have Appalachian roots from parents and grandparents who migrated north for once-plentiful factory jobs available to workers without college degrees.Trump rode their support in two sweeping victories in Ohio, and you can still find Trump flags, banners and yard signs left in place by diehards around the region.

A yearlong lockout of 2,700 workers that began in 2006 underscored that the company's patriarchal days of having a park, sports teams and a golf course for workers and their families here were long past.It was once known nationally for Jerry Lucas, a 1950s \u201cMiddie\u201d high school standout who went on to college and NBA stardom. Vance has helped \u201cput Middletown back on the map,\u201d Muterspaw said.Staffers at Middletown High School had trouble finding Vance in the 2003 yearbook, his senior year. They looked under Vance, which was his \u201cPapaw\u2019s\u201d family name he took for himself in adulthood, and also under Bowman, his biological father\u2019s last name. They finally found James Hamel, the last name of a stepfather who adopted J.D. early in his mother\u2019s series of husbands and boyfriends.A woman answering the door at the two-story home where he spent much of his childhood across from Miami Park had no idea Vance had ever lived there.At Richie\u2019s Pawn Central \u2014 in business since the early 1950s, though Vance mistakenly wrote it had \u201clong since closed\u201d \u2014 sales employee Terry Stephens grumbled that the federal stimulus checks have slowed down the pawn business.

Several U.S. House members are considering a run. Among them is 10-term Rep. Mike Turner of Dayton, who shares Breathitt County, Kentucky, family roots with Vance.Looming over the race is Trump \u2014 and his coveted, but not yet secured, endorsement.

Thiel arranged and attended the meet-and-greet at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was private.John Forren, a Miami University political scientist in Vance's native Butler County, said he thinks Vance has a potentially winning appeal.In the battle to win Trump's backing, GOP foes are likely to highlight Vance's past criticisms of Trump, such as in a 2016 NPR interview in which he said: \u201cI can\u2019t stomach Trump. I think that he\u2019s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\u201dHowever, Anirudh Ruhil, who teaches government analytics at Ohio University, nestled in Appalachian southeast Ohio, thinks Vance can overcome that.\u201cRight now, J.D.
