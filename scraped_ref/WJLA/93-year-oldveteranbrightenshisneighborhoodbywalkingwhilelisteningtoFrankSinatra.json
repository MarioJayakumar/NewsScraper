{"title": "93-year-old veteran brightens his neighborhood by walking while listening to Frank Sinatra", "body": "Daniel Kershaw served in the Navy for 26 years and then became a teacher.Even at age 93, he stays busy and healthy by going for a walk through his Rhode Island neighborhood every day.He's such a fixture that neighbors get concerned when they don't see him.When Kershaw had to stay home after a couple of recent falls, his son Daniel Jr. says, neighbors asked about him and were relieved to see him out walking again after he recovered.\u201cHe\u2019s always been my hero of course and an inspiration,\u201d said Daniel Jr. \u201cHe\u2019s exercised everyday day that I can remember of my whole life. If he doesn\u2019t get out, he doesn\u2019t feel good. So it\u2019s a really strong need for him to get out even at this age first in the morning.\u201d\u201cI walk well over a mile every morning weather permitting,\" the elder Daniel said. \"Rain doesn\u2019t stop me but snow and the ice do. It\u2019s my exercise, keeps my blood flowing.\"Mr. Kershaw moved into his son\u2019s home about 20 years ago. That was around the same time Christine Sullivan, who lives across the street, started noticing a pattern.\u201cEvery day he\u2019s out here walking,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cHe always waves. He always hears you when you\u2019re driving by, walking by, he\u2019s always pleasant.\u201d\u201cThe biggest thing for me is when I get up in the morning and I open my shades I kind of think it\u2019s a cold rotten day I don\u2019t feel like doing anything and then I see Mr. Kershaw walking and it inspires me to get moving,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cIt\u2019s huge that he just keeps going. He keeps getting back up or rehabbing and coming back out here and keeps going.\u201dAs long as he can move his walker while playing Frank Sinatra on his iPod he says he'll be OK.Daniel Kershaw is a grandfather of eight and a great-grandfather of four.", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/abc7-salutes/93-year-old-veteran-brightens-his-neighborhood-by-walking-while-listening-to-frank-sinatra", "date": "2021-03-26T14:05:18.000Z"}
