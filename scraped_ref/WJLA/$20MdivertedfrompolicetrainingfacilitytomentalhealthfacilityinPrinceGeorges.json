{"title": "$20M diverted from police training facility to mental health facility in Prince George's", "body": "In Prince George's County,  a third of the people locked up by police have mental illnesses but instead of getting treated, they sit in jail because there is no other option. \"This is a behavioral health desert, Prince George's County is,\" Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said Tuesday.Calling the lack of mental health treatment facilities a growing crisis, Alsobrooks diverted $20 million that would have gone to a new police training facility to convert a vacant building into a mental health facility. The space is now gutted but used to be a nursing home. By December, it will be reopened and repurposed as an outpatient behavioral health center on the first floor, and when state approval is granted, a 16-bed inpatient facility on the second floor.  \"We want to be able to serve the needs of the 1 in 10 people in Prince George county who need treatment as we stand here today,\" Doctors Community Hospital President Deneen Richmond explains.Alsobrooks says far too often police are called when people are in a mental health crisis. That can lead to violence and what is perceived as injustice. She says that isn't fair to the officers themselves and seldom does it lead to healing. \"Nobody wants our family members being treated in a correctional facility when they can be treated truly healed in a facility that befits their dignity,\" Alsobrooks says.The county executive says what she has done is not defunding the police, even though the funds were taken from public safety, but rather she has aligned spending with the values of the community.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/new-mental-health-facility-being-built-in-md", "date": "2021-04-19T18:49:10.000Z"}
