() \u2013 It's as eerie as it is beautiful: the Pacific Ocean turned a glowing blue hue Saturday night as bioluminescent season has begun. was out at Kalaloch figuring conditions were ripe to catch the phenomenon, and he was correct! say the blue glow comes from a natural chemical process inside living bodies known as bioluminescence.Nichols has been chasing and photographing bioluminescence for some time along our coast. Usually you need a stretch of mild weather and calm ocean conditions to spot the glow -- check, and check this past week. Also make sure the air is rather dry because the common spring and summer fogs that hug the beaches can ruin your experience.He says you can see the glow with your naked eye, but you must make sure to limit any light pollution. He suggests going in the dead of night, at a time when the moon has either set or is near the new phase. Turn off any and all flashlights/phones and give your eyes a bit to adjust to the darkness.
