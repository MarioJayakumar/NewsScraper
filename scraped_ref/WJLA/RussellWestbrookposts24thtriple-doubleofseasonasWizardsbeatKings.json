Coach Luke Walton was hit with one in the final two minutes.\u201cIt gets frustrating sometimes,\u201d Walton said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably more frustrating because of how we\u2019re playing right now. That\u2019s what we can control. We can\u2019t control the other stuff. We have to clean up our own side of the street before we start complaining about others.\u201dWIZARDRY?Washington dominated Sacramento on the boards and in shooting.
