The killing of 46-year-old George Floyd sparked outrage and protests across the country. Chauvin decided to not testify earlier this week.Before the trial continued this week, Daunte Wright was shot and killed by an officer in a Minneapolis suburb Sunday night. Officer Kim Potter claimed she was going for her Taser but grabbed and used her firearm instead, fatally shooting the 20-year-old. She was charged with second-degree manslaughter on Wednesday. \"The profession of policing has not helped communities through this racial justice emergency. Our roots as a profession are born from the seed of white supremacy. And we have not cut deep enough to remove the rot and grow anew,\" Chief Towers wrote.He also said he does not fault the public for not trusting law enforcement, saying, \"We must earn trust with the community in each decision because some, in our profession, continue to break that trust over and over again. As you have come to expect, the Cheverly Police Department will continue to demonstrate its commitment to protecting the dignity of all people and the sanctity of human life. I am confident that our officers represent Cheverly\u2019s values in everything they do, because we share those values too.\"Read the entire letter from Chief Jarod Towers below:", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/md-police-chief-addresses-racial-justice-emergency-ahead-of-pro-police-gathering", "date": "2021-04-17T15:16:41.000Z"}
