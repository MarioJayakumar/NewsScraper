Now, Shannon Sundy is providing relief. The AU freshman is tutoring the second-grader in one-hour sessions four days a week through the university's just launched 'Virtual Tutoring Corps.'\"Under the CARES Act, the federal government is covering the entire cost of the salary for Federal Work Study students,\" said Max Friedman, Interim Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at American University. \"So, this is something the university is able to do even though we're faced with our own fiscal constraints.\"The tutoring program provides employment for AU students who are eligible for the needs-based federal awards but haven't been working due to the pandemic.\"It's really rewarding and fulfilling,\" said Sundy.The partnership benefits university students, employees, and their children.\"His reading has improved, and I can see his learning and comprehension of the text is improving and yeah, he just seems like a happy kid,\" said Marvar about her son Elliot.\"So far we've been able to match 89 AU students with the children of 89 faculty and staff,\" Friedman said.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-university-matching-kids-employees-students-virtually-tutor-them", "date": "2021-02-23T21:39:54.000Z"}
