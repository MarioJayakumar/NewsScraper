We can never say thank you enough for each and every person who drank DC Brau this past year!!!\"One of those ways the brewery will celebrate is with 'The Public.' On April 15, 2011, DC Brau officially tapped its first keg of 'The Public' at Meridian Pint in Columbia Heights.Since then, they've brewed close to 40,000 barrels of 'The Public', which continues to be a DC favorite.\"We're honoring our first brew with a year-long celebration of The Public. Each month, we're going to brew a special batch of The Public using a different hop each month. You can find the special packs by looking for the red pack caps in stores and through the brewery.\"Over the past decade, DC Brau has also made close to $300,000 in contributions to important community organizations.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-brau-celebrates-10-years-of-brewing-beer-and-giving-back", "date": "2021-04-13T22:53:35.000Z"}
