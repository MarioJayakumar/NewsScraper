Underwood kicked off the performance with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and \u201cGreat Is Thy Faithfulness,\u201d then Winans joined in, matching her strong vocal performance.Collaborative moments were a theme during the awards show.Miranda Lambert, the most decorated artist in the history of the ACM Awards, kicked off the show alongside rock-pop singer Elle King for a fun, energetic performance of their new duet.

Morris later won song of the year for her Grammy-nominated hit \u201cThe Bones,\" which topped the country music charts for months last year.\u201cWhen I wrote ('The Bones') I was dating my now-husband and it was just a song to him. And I feel sometimes, like, songs know you better than you know them at the time. And I feel like this song has revealed so many new things to me,\" a teary-eyed Morris said onstage. \u201cAnd this is just been a hell of a year and hopefully country music and maybe even this song brought you and your family and friends some peace.\"Other set to perform include Blake Shelton, Alan Jackson, Dan + Shay, Brothers Osborne and Ashley McBryde.Lambert, who has won 35 ACMs, is nominated for five honors and has a chance of extending her record.
