{"title": "'DCYOutside': DC Youth Orchestra Program returns to in-person rehearsal", "body": "More than 200 students gathered Saturday for in-person rehearsal through D.C. Youth Orchestra Program, the first in-person rehearsal for the program in more than a year.\u201cWe've been separated from it so long, it feels new to us again and yet at the same time, we are coming back to that thing that we love so much and so we're very excited,\u201d said Principal Conductor Kenneth Whitley.The group gathered at Takoma Education Campus in Northwest Washington under two big tents.Hugh Shepard, a senior in high school and trombone player, was among those in attendance ready for in-person rehearsal.\u201cThe virtual experience just really doesn't compare to being able to hear the sound of the orchestra, making live music together,\u201d said Shepard.Safety was also top of mind for the launching of the \u201cDCYOutside\u201d program.In the previous weeks, there were two pilot rehearsals.One rehearsal took place at Takoma Education Campus, and the other took place under the pavilion at The Fields at RFK Campus, which the organization says will operate as a supplementary rehearsal space.The executive director of the program says leaders applied the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s indoor COVID-19 guidelines to the outdoor space for extra precautions, but the safety measures didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cNot only are the students going to be having masks and social distanced, but the instruments are going to have masks on, so our winds and brass will be played through specialized masks and their instruments will have bell covers as an extra safety precaution,\u201d said Executive Director Elizabeth Schurgin.She\u2019s hopeful that the students will be able to have a concert in June.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-youth-orchestra-program-returns-to-in-person-rehearsal", "date": "2021-04-18T01:05:04.000Z"}
