{"title": "Building wind turbines gives middle school girls hands-on STEM learning", "body": "7News was there on Tuesday when a group of girls at Potomac Middle School in Dumfries finalized the wind turbines they were building as part of an after-school program on green energy.The seven week long program, \u201cGirl Power\u2014Intro to Green Energy\u201d, was put together by a nonprofit group called Pink Space Theory with the support of a $7,500 grant from Dominion Energy.\u201cWhat I love about this program is that it gives students an opportunity to do real hands-on engineering learning,\u201d said Monica Nichols, founder and President of Pink Space Theory, a nonprofit created to help close the STEM gender and race equality gap. The school identified students from underserved and minority communities that had not previously expressed interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) subjects or careers for the program.\u201cSometimes in the field it can be, men put stuff together. No, women put stuff together.  Women can do this too.  And I feel like harnessing that creativity, having them know that they can do this. Every single girl created a successful wind turbine,\u201d said Kaitlin Peterman, one of two Dominion Energy women engineers helping to teach a dozen girls how to build their own wind turbine.\u201cThis is turning wind energy into mechanical energy because its spinning the gear. And then the gear is spinning a generator which turning it into electrical energy,\u201d Peterman said.The middle school girls watched their wind turbines spin in the wind, beaming at their creations.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/building-wind-turbines-gives-middle-school-girls-hands-on-stem-learning", "date": "2021-04-17T15:58:56.000Z"}
