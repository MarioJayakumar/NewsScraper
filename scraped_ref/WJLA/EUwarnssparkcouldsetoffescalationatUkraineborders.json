The EU has steadfastly opposed the annexation but has been unable to do anything about it.Efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled and violations of a shaky truce have become increasingly frequent in recent weeks across Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.Diplomats had expected there was little to no chance of immediate new sanctions on Moscow, but they now will seek to apply more pressure nevertheless through diplomacy.And over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron said that while dialogue with Russia is essential, \"clear red lines\" carrying possible sanctions must also be drawn with Moscow over Ukraine.\"We call on Russia to withdraw their troops,\" Borrell said.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/nation-world/eu-warns-spark-could-set-off-escalation-at-ukraine-borders", "date": "2021-04-20T01:26:41.000Z"}
