{"title": "Kyle Schwarber debuts and helps leads Nats over Cardinals 5-2", "body": "Kyle Schwarber doubled home a run in his delayed Nationals debut, Andrew Stevenson had a pinch-hit homer and Washington beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-2 Monday night.Schwarber, Josh Bell and Josh Harrison were in the starting lineup after being sidelined for Washington\u2019s first six games by a coronavirus outbreak that prompted the postponement of the team\u2019s season-opening series and left the club short-handed. The Nats ended a five-game skid, while the Cardinals lost their third straight.\u201cWe talked about it before the game: Fresh start for all of us, our guys are back,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cSo let\u2019s forget about the first six games and start today.\u201dStevenson hit his first homer of the season into St. Louis\u2019 bullpen in right field leading off the seventh inning, putting Washington ahead 4-2. The solo shot was just his fourth homer in 221 career at-bats.Kyle Finnegan (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings, giving up a run on one hit. He struck out two.Schwarber, acquired in the offseason after the Chicago Cubs declined to offer him a contract, hit a 1-0 pitch from starter John Gant into right-center to drive in Juan Soto, who singled to start the sixth.\u201cI felt like a lot of guys had great at-bats all night, working deep counts and making that guy grind out there,\u201d Schwarber said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s contagious.\u201dThe Nationals added a run on the next pitch from reliever Giovanny Gallegos when Starlin Castro hit a sacrifice fly to foul territory in right, driving in Bell.Gant (0-1) went five innings and gave up three runs. He allowed six hits, struck out four and walked three.\u201cThe challenge tonight was not getting them all out,\u201d Gant said about the sixth inning, when the first three batters reached against him. \u201cThey got a couple of knocks and got me out.\u201dWashington had a chance to break the game open when the first four batters reached to start the eighth against reliever Andrew Miller, including Castro singling home Bell. Ryan Helsley struck out Yan Gomes, and pinch-hitter Ryan Zimmerman flied out to center fielder Dylan Carlson, who threw out Schwarber at home to end the inning.Yadier Molina hit his second homer of the season in the sixth to pull the Cardinals to 3-2.Matt Carpenter ended an 0-for-12 start to the season with a bunt single in the third and scored on Tommy Edman\u2019s hit, tying the game at 1. Carpenter has struggled at the plate since spring training, with just two hits in 37 at-bats, including 13 strikeouts.\u201cI was just glad to get one on the board,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cSometimes the first one is the hardest. It obviously was for me.\u201dVictor Robles led off the game with his second triple of the season and scored on Soto\u2019s one-out single to give the Nationals a 1-0 lead.TRAINER\u2019S ROOMNationals: Schwarber, Bell and Harrison were reinstated from the COVID-19 injured list before the game. The moves make the team\u2019s roster nearly whole again after an outbreak sidelined nine players and postponed four games. Five players returned over the weekend; the only one still missing is LHP Jon Lester, who will ramp up at the team\u2019s alternate training site before joining the Nationals. Martinez said most of the players on the team were vaccinated at their hotel in St. Louis.Cardinals: St. Louis is closer to having two of its starting pitchers back from the injured list. LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (back tightness) threw 86 pitches Sunday, and manager Mike Schildt said everything looked good for him to get back to the club soon, though he didn\u2019t give a timeline. Shildt also said the progress of RHP Miles Mikolas (shoulder stiffness) is on target. Mikolas threw a bullpen Monday at Busch Stadium. He\u2019ll throw another in a few days, after which the Cardinals will determine if he\u2019s ready to face hitters.UP NEXTNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (0-0, 0.00 ERA) starts Tuesday. He gave up one hit while striking out eight over six scoreless innings in a 2-0 loss during the second game of a doubleheader last Wednesday against Atlanta.Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (1-0, 5.23 ERA) gets his third start of the season and is coming off a strong outing at Miami, where he gave up one hit and struck out six in six shutout innings.", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/content/schwarber-debuts-leads-nats-over-cardinals-5-2-04-13-2021", "date": "2021-04-13T13:01:22.000Z"}
