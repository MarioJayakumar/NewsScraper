Boulders were hurled by the pressurized nitrogen gas that was fired at the ground to churn up material for vacuuming, and by the spacecraft's getaway thruster. One 1-ton boulder was flung an estimated 40 feet (12 meters).The Osiris-Rex team meticulously plotted the final flyover to ensure the best shots.

It's due to arrive in 2023.The solar-orbiting, carbon-rich asteroid is 182 million miles (293 million kilometers) from Earth. By studying pieces of it, scientists hope to better understand how our solar system's planets formed and how people should react if an asteroid endangers Earth.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/nasa-spacecraft-leaves-mess-after-grabbing-asteroid-samples", "date": "2021-04-15T22:22:19.000Z"}
