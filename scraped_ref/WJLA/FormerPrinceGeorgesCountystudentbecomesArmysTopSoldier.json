It means a lot. Honestly, it really hasn't hit me,\" Sergeant Akinola said.What hasn't hit home is the reality that the 30-year-old is now the Army's 'Top Soldier'; a title he earned after competing in the 2020 Best Warrior Competition.How did he prepare?\"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I did the two to four-mile runs then Tuesday and Thursday I did three to six-mile runs,\" he said.For a month and a half, the combat medic endured weighted runs, water workouts, gym sessions, and hours of study.22 soldiers and non-commissioned officers competed in the challenge.Among the requirements:  an Army Combat Fitness Test, a 12-mile foot march, a rifle qualification test, plus a written exam, essay, and interviews.\"The most challenging was training and competing through injury,\" he said.The 2009 Bowie High School graduate trained and competed with a pulled hamstring and still won the Top Soldier award.The best part of winning?\"To be an inspiration to other people.  So, I am accomplishing that as a non-commissioned officer.  It's no longer about me anymore.  It's about my soldiers.\"Bowie High Principal Joe Kautzer hopes Akinola's achievement will also impact current students at the school.\"That they can see themselves in him and it gives them something to aspire to, to know that even in this difficult time we're in, that great things can be accomplished.", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/spotlight-on-education/former-prince-georges-county-student-becomes-armys-top-soldier", "date": "2021-01-13T20:35:13.000Z"}
