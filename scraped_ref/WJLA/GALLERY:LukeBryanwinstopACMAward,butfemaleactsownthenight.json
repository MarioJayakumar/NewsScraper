She was joined by gospel legend CeCe Winans and the dynamic duo blended their voices like angels onstage. Underwood performed songs from her recent gospel hymns album \"My Savior,\" kicking off the set with \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Great Is Thy Faithfulness.\" Then Winans joined in, matching her strong vocal performance.Lambert performed three times, first alongside rock-pop singer Elle King for a fun, energetic performance of their new duet \"Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home).\" Lambert, who founded pet shelter nonprofit MuttNation, also performed alongside album of the year winner Chris Stapleton for \"Maggie's Song,\" a tribute to Stapleton's dog who died 2019.

You've inspired me so much to no end, and even in a year where no one's gotten to play shows, I have heard some of the best music out of all of you this past year. So thank you so much for inspiring me,\" she said.Collaborating onstage was the theme of the awards show, and Morris and hubby Ryan Hurd sang together, ending with a kiss. A teary-eyed Morris won song of the year for her Grammy-nominated hit \"The Bones,\" which topped the country music charts for months last year. She won two ACMs for song of the year \u2014 one for performing the hit and another for co-writing it, sharing the win with songwriters Laura Veltz and Jimmy Robbins.Morris lost single of the year, where all of the nominated songs were performed by female artists.

She recently had her first child and became the first Black solo woman nominated for a Grammy in the country category this year.Little Big Town also performed \u2014 but as a threesome. The Grammy winners sang \"Wine, Beer, Whiskey\" without band member Phillip Sweet since he recently tested positive for COVID-19.Sweet and Bryan weren't the only country stars missing from the show.
