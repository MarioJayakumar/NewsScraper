{"title": "7News investigates: Why are some people in DC waiting weeks for their mail to arrive?", "body": "If you ask someone in D.C. about mail delivery these days, Chris Davis says he\u2019s still waiting today for a check his firm said they mail him March 15th. Moira Jones says she never knows when mail will arrive, maybe noon, maybe 9 o\u2019clock at night. Tom Wiener says at least one or two days a week he does get mail. Kimberly Hart says she used to get mail every day, she doesn\u2019t anymore and she doesn\u2019t know whether she's supposed to.Clearly, mail service in D.C. and likely other places as well is not what it used to be.And on a personal note:  Yesterday, this reporter got a text from a cousin who works for a radio station, WGBH in Boston, who said they had sent me a letter testing mail delivery. Had I received it yet, he asked. I said no. I haven\u2019t received any mail at all since last Saturday, six days ago.Keith Hooks, president of the local branch of the Letter Carriers Union, said recently it\u2019s about short staffing and COVID-19.  He says if workers are quarantined, then the work is overwhelming.\u201cSome of our carriers in D.C. and some parts of Maryland are carrying two routes a day,\" said Hooks. \"You may see your mail at 8,  9 o\u2019clock at night. Why?  Because the carriers  have to carry their route-and-a- half,  if not a whole route, of another.\u201dWe requested an interview at D.C. postal headquarters.  They \u201crespectfully decline\u201d.In a statement, they said: \u201cOccasionally staffing is impacted by COVID-19 that can cause delays in isolated areas.\u201d Another personal note: They added that somebody had been to my house to hand-deliver the mail.  I\u2019ll find out when I get home.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/local/7news-investigates-why-are-some-people-in-dc-are-waiting-weeks-for-their-mail-to-arrive", "date": "2021-04-16T21:46:23.000Z"}
