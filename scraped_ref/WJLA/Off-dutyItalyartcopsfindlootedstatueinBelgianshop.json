It was stolen in November 2011 from the Villa Marini Dettina archaeological site on the outskirts of the capital, the statement said.Two members of the art squad's archaeological unit were on assignment in Brussels when they took a walk after work in the Sablon neighborhood that is known for its antiques shops. They spotted a marble statue in a shop that they suspected was from Italy, and confirmed their suspicions when they cross-referenced the work with a database of known stolen antiquities, the statement said.Italy for decades has worked to recover looted antiquities that have ended up in private collections, famous museums and commercial antique shops around the world.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/off-duty-italy-art-cops-find-looted-statue-in-belgian-shop", "date": "2021-04-12T15:14:14.000Z"}
