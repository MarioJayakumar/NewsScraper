In the end, though, Biden said he\u2019ll get Americans out, but he won\u2019t beat a \u201chasty\u201d retreat under his predecessor's timeline. Instead, he called for a monthslong exit ramp even as Republicans \u2014 and a few Democrats \u2014 criticized the withdrawal as ill-advised.Lisa Curtis, who served as National Security Council senior director for South and Central Asia in the Trump administration, said lost in Biden\u2019s desire to end the war this year is that the U.S. had effectively right-sized the American presence with roughly 2,500 troops. It\u2019s not cheap, she noted, but it's a relatively modest cost to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a terrorist safe haven.It\u2019s been more than a year since an American service member has been killed in combat in Afghanistan. Curtis argued that with the relatively modest troop presence, the U.S. could maintain a crucial intelligence foothold in a dangerous part of the world, something that Biden\u2019s CIA director, William Burns, acknowledged could be diminished by the Biden's push-pull calibrations were also evident this past week in his approach to Russia.The president levied  for cyberattacks and interference in the 2020 election, expelling 10 Russian diplomats and targeting Moscow\u2019s ability to borrow money by prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian bonds.But Biden, who in February had declared an end to the days of the U.S. \u201crolling over\u201d to Vladimir Putin, simultaneously suggested that he was getting tough on the Russian president and asserted that he wants a \u201cstable, predictable\u201d relationship with him. The president also suggested a summer summit with Putin.Biden said he made clear to Putin during a phone call on Tuesday, two days before the sanctions were publicly announced, that he could have been much tougher on the Russians.\u201cI was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI chose to be proportionate.\u201dThe past week also brought new steps from Biden on refugee admissions that showed the administration's efforts to navigate the fraught politics of the issue. The president issued an emergency declaration stating that the limit of 15,000 refugee admissions set by Trump for this year \u201cremains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.\u201dThe move marked a dramatic departure from Biden\u2019s campaign promise to raise the refugee limit to 125,000 and then to at least 95,000 annually after that. It came as the Biden administration is struggling to deal with a sharp increase in unaccompanied young migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras arriving at the border.After an avalanche of criticism from Democratic lawmakers, the White House within hours made a quick course correction on Friday. It said Biden next month would increase the historically low cap on refugees set by Trump \u2014 but probably not even to the 62,500 level that was in a plan submitted to Congress in February. The number actually admitted is expected to be closer to 15,000.Before the Biden administration did its walk-back, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, cheered Biden\u2019s move in a tweet that laid bare the political ramifications of the issue.\u201cThis reflects Team Biden\u2019s awareness that the border flood will cause record midterm losses (asterisk)if(asterisk) GOP keeps issue front & center,\u201d Miller tweeted.Biden over the years has displayed a willingness to cut against his party's grain at times on foreign policy matters. As vice president, he frequently found himself out of sync with some of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy advisers.Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, in his memoir, wrote that Biden had been \u201cwrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201d Early in Obama\u2019s tenure, Gen. Stanley McCrystal publicly suggested Biden was \u201cshortsighted\u201d in urging the president to focus on a smaller counterterrorism effort in Afghanistan while military leaders were urging a troop buildup.As Biden looks to lay down his own markers on foreign policy in the opening months of his presidency, others in Obama world say the president and his team have shown an ambitious reach in the early going.Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama years, credits Biden\u2019s team for taking a unique step by issuing interim national security strategic guidance in March, months before the administration was required to do so. The early guidance sent a message around the globe that they\u2019re serious about breaking from the past four years, McFaul said.\u201cThey have a much bigger ambition for their foreign policy,\u201d said McFaul, now director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. \u201cI cannot think of an administration that has ever done that before.\u201d___", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/nation-world/on-foreign-policy-decisions-biden-faces-drag-of-pragmatism", "date": "2021-04-17T17:00:33.000Z"}
