{"title": "Fox stands behind Tucker Carlson after ADL urges his firing", "body": "Fox Corp. is standing behind Tucker Carlson after the  last week called for the company to fire the opinion host for his on-air defense of the white-supremacist \"great replacement\" theory.In a letter sent Sunday to the civil rights group and shared with The Associated Press,  said Carlson had \"decried and rejected replacement theory\" when he said during the Thursday evening segment, \"White replacement theory? No, no, this is a voting rights question.\"The ADL argued in a reply sent Monday to Murdoch that  used white-supremacist language even if he claimed he didn't.The replacement conspiracy theory holds that people of color are replacing white people in the West, enabled by Jews and progressive politicians.During a guest appearance Thursday on \"Fox News Primetime,\" Carlson \"embraced a foundational theory of white supremacy,\" the ADL said.The ADL also listed numerous instances Carlson has used anti-immigrant language in the past, including blaming immigration for making the U.S. \"poorer, and dirtier, and more divided,\" and questioned whether white supremacy was real.Murdoch noted in his letter that the ADL had once honored his father, Rupert Murdoch, with a leadership award. The ADL's Greenblatt replied that the award was granted \"over a decade ago, but let me be clear that we would not do so today, and it does not absolve you, him, the network, or its board from the moral failure of not taking action against Mr. Carlson.\"A Fox spokesperson declined to comment on the ADL's Monday letter.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/fox-stands-behind-tucker-carlson-after-adl-urges-his-firing", "date": "2021-04-12T22:22:59.000Z"}
