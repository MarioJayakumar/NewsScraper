{"title": "Washington Nationals celebrate Jackie Robinson Day", "body": "The Washington Nationals and Major League Baseball are celebrating Jackie Robinson Day today.All MLB players, managers, coaches and umpires will wear Robinson's iconic No. 42 to help mark the anniversary of the date Robinson broke baseball's color barrier in 1947.Additionally, the '42' logo will be on uniform sleeves and caps, and special batting practice t-shirts, designed by The Players Alliance, will be worn by players prior to games.A tradition since 2004, all MLB teams will commemorate Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks throughout the league on April 15.  Teams that are off Thursday will honor Robinson when they play Friday.In 1997, Major League Baseball honored Robinson by making his No. 42 the first uniform number to be retired across the sport.  No player for the Washington Nationals has ever worn No. 42 since the number was retired eight years before the franchise relocated to Washington from Montreal.  The last player to wear No. 42 for the Expos was pitcher Kirk Rueter (1993-1996).", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-nationals/washington-nationals-celebrate-jackie-robinson-day", "date": "2021-04-15T19:23:57.000Z"}
