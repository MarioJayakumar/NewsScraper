Fewer viewers equal fewer ad dollars.Through the trade group Video Advertising Bureau, the networks are perplexed by Nielsen statistics that show the percentage of Americans who watched their televisions at least some time during the week declined from 92% in 2019 to 87% so far this year.Besides being counter-intuitive in the pandemic era, the VAB says that finding runs counter to other evidence, including viewing measurements from set-top cable boxes, the increased amount of streaming options that have become available and a jump in sales for television sets.\u201cWe think the market deserves a lot more clarity,\u201d said Sean Cunningham, president and CEO of the VAB, on Tuesday.The number of families, particularly large families, participating in Nielsen measurements has dropped over the past year in percentages similar to the decrease in viewership, Cunningham said.

NBC had 3.46 million, ABC had 3.45 million, Fox had 1.8 million, Univision had 1.3 million, Telemundo had 1.1 million, Ion Television had 1 million and the CW had 720,000.Fox News Channel led the cable networks, averaging 2.12 million viewers in prime time.
