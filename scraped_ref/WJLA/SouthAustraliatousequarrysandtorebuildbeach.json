It is in its own right an Australian community, offering a place to belong and grow and be safe. It provides mateship, education, experience. In so doing, Surf Life Saving gives back to the community.Surf Life Saving is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in the world.(Edited by Vaibhav Vishwanath Pawar and Ritaban Misra)", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/south-australia-to-use-quarry-sand-to-rebuild-beach", "date": "2021-04-19T16:42:30.000Z"}
