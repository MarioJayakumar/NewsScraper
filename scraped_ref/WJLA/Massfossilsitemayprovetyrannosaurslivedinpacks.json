Excavation has been ongoing since the site's discovery because of the size of the area and volume of bones.The new Utah site is the third mass tyrannosaur grave site that's been discovered in North America and provides even more evidence that tyrannosaurs may have lived in groups, Titus said.The social tyrannosaurs theory began over 20 years ago when more than a dozen tyrannosaurs were found at a site in Alberta, Canada. Another mass death site in Montana again raised the possibility of social tyrannosaurs. Many scientists questioned the theory, arguing that the dinosaurs didn't have the brainpower to engage in sophisticated social interaction, Titus said.\u201cGoing that next step to understand behavior and how animals behave requires really amazing evidence,\u201d Joseph Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, said at the news conference. \u201cI think that this site, the spectacular collection of tyrannosaurs but also the other assembled pieces of evidence ... pushes us to the point where we can show some evidence for behavior.\u201dIn addition to the tyrannosaurs, researchers have also found seven species of turtles, multiple fish and ray species, two other kinds of dinosaurs and a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile Deinosuchus alligator. These other animals do not appear to have all died together.Paleontology groups have been among those pushing the federal government to restore the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante to their original sizes to protect the region\u2019s rich paleontological and archaeological record.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah earlier this month as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse Trump\u2019s decision to downsize the monuments. Titus said he showed Haaland some of the fossils at his lab during her visit and said she \u201cappreciated getting to see the material.\u201d", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/mass-fossil-site-may-prove-tyrannosaurs-lived-in-packs", "date": "2021-04-19T22:23:00.000Z"}
