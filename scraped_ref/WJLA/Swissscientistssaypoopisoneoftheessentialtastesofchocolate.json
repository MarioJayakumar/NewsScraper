However, only a few contribute significantly to the characteristic chocolate aroma.\u201cInterestingly, there is not a single compound that smells like cocoa; rather, the interplay of several chemical compounds is what creates the cocoa aroma,\u201d said Chetschik.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/swiss-scientists-say-poop-is-one-of-the-essential-tastes-of-chocolate", "date": "2021-04-19T16:28:19.000Z"}
