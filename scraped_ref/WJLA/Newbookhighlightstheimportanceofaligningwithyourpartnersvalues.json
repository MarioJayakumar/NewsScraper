He also encourages readers to set goals based on the values they prioritize most. Through these self-reflective exercises, Jenkins hopes that readers will learn how to remain equally yoked with their partners.In the book, Jenkins implores readers to redefine the word, \"perfect,\" by being committed to taking ownership of a situation. Jenkins' definition of \"perfect\" includes both the good, the bad, the successes, and the failures that a person may encounter in life. Redefining perfect is the key to overcoming challenges, growing from the past, and transforming the future.", "url": "https://wjla.com/sponsored/spotlight/new-book-highlights-the-importance-of-aligning-with-your-partners-values", "date": "2021-02-24T17:45:31.000Z"}
