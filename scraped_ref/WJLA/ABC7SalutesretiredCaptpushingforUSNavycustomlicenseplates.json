{"title": "ABC7 Salutes retired Capt. pushing for U.S. Navy custom license plates", "body": "In Virginia, you can find 300 different custom license plates and among them the U.S. Army, U.S. Marines and the U.S. Coast Guard.  Missing from all these plates is one representing the U.S. Navy. For retired Captain Roger Hirsh, that needs to be changed.ABC7 asked him how long he has been working on this?  \u201cThree and a half years and it got started in the first place because I was frustrated the Navy didn\u2019t have its own plate.\u201dCaptain Hirsh found it\u2019s not so easy getting a custom plate made.  First, he has to get the a law passed through the general assembly, which he suspects won\u2019t be a problem.  He also has to get 450 prepaid orders in and right now he has about 293 plates sold.\u201cIt\u2019s been a big of an uphill battle\u201d Hirsh admits, but he argues that Virginia is home to the largest Naval Base in the entire world so of all the places to give the Navy some love Virginia should be that place.  Afterall the slogan for the state is Virginia is for lovers.He\u2019s hoping the plate will be available by summer; it's available for pre-order .", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/abc7-salutes/abc7-salutes-retired-capt-pushing-for-us-navy-custom-license-plates", "date": "2020-12-05T00:40:18.000Z"}
