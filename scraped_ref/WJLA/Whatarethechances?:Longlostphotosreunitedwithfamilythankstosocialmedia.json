{"title": "'What are the chances?': Long lost photos reunited with family thanks to social media ", "body": "() \u2014 There are few gifts more treasured than memories. For Alexia Small and her children Mason and Aliya the past matters. Especially, moments they never thought they\u2019d relive again.\u201cOh my God! What are the chances! Just the whole experience is just a little surreal, but it goes beyond getting the pictures back,\u201d says Small.In late March, an SUV rolled down Alexia Small\u2019s long driveway in Loudoun County for a most improbable reunion. Leanne Littman had in her hands a prized possession Small never imagined she see again.As Littman walks up Small\u2019s front porch she says, \u201cSo 16 years in the making.\u201d\u201cThank you so much,\u201d responds Small.For the first time Leanne and Alexia are meeting, due to an unexpected, literal bump in the road years ago.Small recalls, \u201cI remember sticking the little camera in the little top zipper compartment so I must not have zipped it all the way.\u201dSmall was aboard this motorcycle in 2005 heading from her home in Leesburg to her parent\u2019s house in Maryland. She was going to her folk\u2019s place to show them all the pictures she had just taken during a family trip to Rome, Italy.But, while navigating a gravel road the camera, tucked away in a leather bag, fell out. Small didn\u2019t realize she's lost the camera while going down Sycolin Road until she got to her parent\u2019s house. Leanne Littman was driving by soon thereafter.Littman says, \u201cI could see something I just wasn\u2019t sure what it was. I wasn\u2019t sure if was a camera or a phone. I\u2019m not sure. It was just something that sparkled in the weeds on the side of the road.\u201dShe picked up the camera and uploaded the pictures hoping she\u2019d recognize someone.\u201cWow, these are lovely vacation pictures of a family in Italy. It was family pictures posing in front of fountains and different places I think in Rome,\u201d adds Littman.No one looked familiar. Little did she know, this family lived only a few miles from her. Littman eventually pitched the camera because it was heavily damage and tossed the old SD card in a drawer and thought nothing of it until boredom set in during the pandemic. As luck would have it, she was rifling through another box and found a card reader.Littman says, \u201cI\u2019m going through a bin we inherited from one of our parents that was full of technology and find this awesome reader.\u201dShe didn\u2019t post these images in 2005 because Facebook wasn\u2019t available to the public back then. A couple weeks ago, with time on her hands, she figured why not.Small says, \u201cShe was basically telling that story that she was on Sycolin Road, found a smashed up camera and as soon as I saw that I knew exactly what it was talking about and I was like Oh my God! Oh my God!\u201dLittman says, \u201cAnd no kidding within 2 hours someone goes I know them. I\u2019m going to message them. And within a few hours we were connecting.\u201dNow, thanks to enduring kindness and the stunning reach of social media, those pictures are home with Small and her children who are now 31 and 26.\u201cThey were flipping out. Oh my God! What are the chances! Pictures and memories are a big part of most of our lives and they are really dear to me so I really appreciate what Leanne did,\u201d says Small.There\u2019s a reason why Italy, Sicily in particular, resides at the core of this story. Generations ago Alexia Small\u2019s grandparents emigrated from Sicily to America. Her grandfather toiled in the coal mines of West Virginia to forge a better life for those who followed. Since most of the family remained in Italy, Alexia returned often, basking in the beauty of coastal life. \u201cEvery few years we\u2019d go as children and spend two months there and it was the best life ever,\u201d says Small.She finally took that tourist vacation, as a mother, in 2005 with then 15-year-old Aliya and 11-year-old Mason. Small adds, \u201cI had never been to the Coliseum myself because I always went to Sicily to see my family, so we went to Rome.\u201dWhat\u2019s a family picture, or a shared memory for that matter, then a reminder of the power we have to be there for each other. For Alexia Small and Leanne Littman, once strangers and now friends, this reunion is about more than sharing the past.\u201cHopefully, it will make us be a little more aware of what we can do. Just a little thing like that. If you find something get it back to the person. You don\u2019t know how much joy it can bring,\u201d says Small.", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/7news-stories/what-are-the-chances-long-lost-photos-reunited-with-family-thanks-to-social-media", "date": "2021-04-10T04:09:01.000Z"}
