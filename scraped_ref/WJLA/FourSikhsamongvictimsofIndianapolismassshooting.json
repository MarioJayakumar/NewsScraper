{"title": "Four Sikhs among victims of Indianapolis mass shooting", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Amarjit Sekhon, a 48-year-old mother of two sons, was the breadwinner of her family and one of many members of Indianapolis\u2019 tight knit Sikh community employed at a FedEx warehouse on the city\u2019s southwest side.Her death Thursday night in a of seven other FedEx employees \u2014 four of them Sikhs \u2014 has left that community stunned and in mourning, her brother-in-law, Kuldip Sekhon, said Saturday.He said his sister-in-law began working at the FedEx facility in November - after previously working at a bakery - and was a dedicated worker whose husband was disabled.\u201cShe was a workaholic, she always was working, working. She would never sit still unless she felt really bad,\u201d he said.In addition to Sekhon, the Marion County Coroner\u2019s office identified the dead late Friday as: Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.Police said Brandon Scott Hole, 19, apparently began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility, killing four, before entering the building, fatally shooting four more people and then turning the gun on himself.It was not clear if Sikhs were targeted in the shooting. Hole\u2019s motives remained unclear Saturday.The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis.Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. The deputy police chief said he did not know why Hole left the job or if he had ties to the workers in the facility.About 90% of the workers at the facility near the Indianapolis International Airport are members of the local Sikh community, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor said Friday. Many of them live in Hendricks County just west of Indianapolis, and on the city\u2019s southside.Kuldip Sekhon said his family lost another relative in the shooting \u2014 Kaur, who was his son\u2019s mother-in-law, and whose first name he said was Jasvinder. He said both Kaur and Amarjit Sekhon began working at the FedEx facility at the same time last November.\u201cThey were both there together for work\u201d when the shooting occurred, he said.Komal Chohan, who said Amarjeet Johal was her grandmother, said in a statement issued by the Sikh Coalition, that her family members, including several who work at the FedEx warehouse, are \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the killings.\u201cMy nani, my family, and our families should not feel unsafe at work, at their place of worship, or anywhere. Enough is enough \u2014 our community has been through enough trauma,\u201d she said in the statement.There are between 8,000 and 10,000 Sikh Americans in Indiana, according to the coalition. Members of the religion, which began in India in the 15th century, began settling in Indiana more than 50 years ago and opened their first house of worship, known as a gurdwara, in 1999.The attack was another blow to the Asian American community a month after six people of Asian descent were in the Atlanta area and amid ongoing attacks against Asian Americans during theThe shooting comes the week Sikhs are celebrating Vaisakhi, a major holiday festival that among other things marks the date Sikhism was born as a collective faith.\u201cWhile we don\u2019t yet know the motive of the shooter, he targeted a facility known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees, and the attack is traumatic for our community as we continue to face senseless violence,\u201d said Satjeet Kaur, the Sikh Coalition\u2019s executive director.The coalition says about 500,000 Sikhs live in the U.S. Many practicing Sikhs are visually distinguishable by their articles of faith, which include the unshorn hair and turban.The shooting is the deadliest incident of violence collectively in the Sikh community in the U.S. since 2012, when a white supremacist burst into a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and shot 10 people, killing six. A seventh died in 2020 from complications stemming from his injuries. That gunman killed himself during a firefight with police.Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Indianapolis field office, said Friday that agents questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d He said the FBI was called after items were found in Hole\u2019s bedroom but he did not elaborate on what they were. He said agents found no evidence of a crime and that they did not identify Hole as espousing a racially motivated ideology.A police report obtained by The Associated Press shows that officers seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole\u2019s home after responding to the mother\u2019s call. Keenan said the gun was never returned.Indianapolis police said Friday that Hole opened fire with a rifle.Samaria Blackwell, of Indianapolis, was a soccer and basketball player who last year graduated from Indy Genesis, a Christian competitive sports organization for homeschooled students. Teammates posted on Facebook that Blackwell \u201cwas always smiling and cracking jokes. She was so loving, goofy, encouraging, and supportive.\u201d Family friends have organized a fundraiser for the Blackwell family to assist with funeral expenses.Several dozen people gathered at the Olivet Missionary Baptist Church on the city\u2019s west side Saturday afternoon to mourn and to call for action.\u201cThe system failed our state the other night,\u201d said Cathy Weinmann, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action. \u201cThat young man should have never had access to a gun  we will not accept this, and we demand better than this for our community.\u201d___Associated Press reporters Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker in Washington and Pat Eaton-Robb in Connecticut contributed to this report.
