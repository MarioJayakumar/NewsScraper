{"title": "VIDEO: Diver's enchanting ocean footage of endangered green turtle ", "body": "HAWAII (Zenger News) \u2014 Andriana Fragola, a shark safety diver for One Ocean Diving in Hawaii, filmed an endangered green sea turtle swimming in shallow waters.The footage shows the cute turtle swimming around and curiously looking at the person filming it.Fragola said the friendly reptile is a green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), listed as endangered on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Fragola, who is from Miami, said she has been diving and snorkeling \u201cbasically since I could walk.\u201d\u201cI have had a passion for oceans since I was a child, so I studied marine science for undergraduate and graduate school and now currently work in the marine science and conservation field,\u201d Fragola said.The turtle encounter happened completely by chance. \u201cGreen sea turtles are actually protected here in Hawaii, so you cannot approach them unless they come up to you,\u201d Fragola said.\u201cA lot of green sea turtles are mating this time of year. This can be seen at the surface of the water from time to time when the male is pursuing the female turtle. Then the females will nest in the summer through fall months.\u201cSharks are beautiful apex predators, but not the monsters the movies and media make them out to be,\u201d Fragola said about her work as a shark safety diver. \u201cUnfortunately, they are being killed by humans at over 100 million sharks every year for many different reasons.\u201cOne is for shark fin soup, which is a delicacy found in China, but now has become a global issue that many countries (including the U.S.) are contributing to. Also, bycatch from fisheries that do not want to catch sharks is a huge issue. Most times when sharks are caught, they are entangled for so long that they do end up dying and being dumped back into the ocean and completely wasted.\u201cMany other threats like targeted killing for shark culls and trophy hunting are also pushing shark populations to decline, as well as pollution and habitat degradation and many others.\u201cYou can definitely coexist with sharks and globally (out of 7.7 billion people) there are only about 10 people that will die from a shark attack each year,\u201d she said.\u201cWe need sharks to regulate the ocean as apex predators and to keep our ecosystems healthy.\u201d\u201cThere is typically a decent amount of runoff and waste that does end up in Hawaii\u2019s oceans,\u201d Fragola said, in regard to waste in the water.", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/offbeat/video-divers-enchanting-ocean-footage-of-endangered-green-turtle", "date": "2021-04-13T14:50:44.000Z"}
