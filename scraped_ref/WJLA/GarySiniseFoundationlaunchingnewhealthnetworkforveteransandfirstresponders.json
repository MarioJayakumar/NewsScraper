He's raised money for causes, and helped build homes for veterans forever changed by war.And now, actor Gary Sinise is stepping up his work to combat the invisible wounds for war with the Avalon Network, pulling together non-profits that all have the same mission to help veterans get the help they need.\u201cWe\u2019re going to revolutionize the way that veterans seek their care,\" says Ken Falke, the chairman of the Boulder Crest Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness. \"Remember, 50 percent of veterans eligible for VA [Veterans Affairs] care will never ever go there, so to focus on that population and try to get them healthy so they will go there... Our goal is to make sure that people are very healthy and can thrive in the aftermath of their trauma.\"Another big partner is the Marcus Institute for Brain Health.\u201cSince 2001 we have deployed 3 million men and women into the war zone and our estimation about one third who\u2019ve served in combat are suffering with PTS or TBI [traumatic brain injury],\" says retired Air Force General Robin Rand, the CEO of the Gary Sinise Foundation.Rand says he's thrilled about this new network because he knows it may just serve as the net to catch those veterans and first responders in need who, right now, are falling through the cracks.\u201cMy greatest hope is to take these American heroes of ours, our veterans and first responders that stand in the gap for us every day, that have served and sacrificed so much in their lives and to help their tomorrow be better than their today,\" Rand says.", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/abc7-salutes/gary-sinise-foundation-launching-new-health-network-for-veterans-and-first-responders", "date": "2021-02-26T17:59:36.000Z"}
