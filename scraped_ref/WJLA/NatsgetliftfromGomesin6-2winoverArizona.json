The finger got straightened out and placed in a splint.\u201cIt\u2019s not crooked anymore,\u201d he said.The Hall of Fame asked for Locastro\u2019s spikes last weekend after he set the record, doing one better than the 28 straight by Tim Raines, who played for the Nationals\u2019 predecessors \u2014 the Montreal Expos \u2014 on his way to being enshrined in Cooperstown.Erick Fedde (1-1) tied his career high with nine strikeouts in five innings for Washington, which is 5-7. He gave up five hits and one run, via Kole Calhoun\u2019s solo shot in the third right after Gomes got Locastro at second base.\u201cThe biggest thing that works for him is when he gets his confidence going,\u201d Gomes said about Fedde.Gomes, who missed the start of the season because of COVID-19 protocols, produced his deep shot in the bottom of the third off Luke Weaver (1-1). Weaver allowed nine hits and four runs in four innings.Washington\u2019s Ryan Zimmerman homered in the eighth. ... Kyle Schwarber \u2014 whose upper-deck shot in the ninth ended the Nationals\u2019 1-0 victory Friday \u2014 and Trea Turner had three hits apiece.Nationals: RHP Wander Suero left after 13 pitches in the ninth because of a left side issue, manager Dave Martinez said. Suero was going to have an MRI after the game. ... LHP Luis Avil\u00e1n, 31, has a torn ligament in his pitching elbow, \u201cso he\u2019s weighing his decision on what to do,\u201d Martinez said. Avil\u00e1n, who went on the IL on Friday, could have Tommy John reconstructive surgery or \u201csit out and see if it heals,\u201d Martinez said, adding: \u201cWe were shocked.\u201d Avil\u00e1n threw 38 pitches Tuesday and 39 Thursday, his most since 40 in a 2017 game. Otherwise, he hadn\u2019t exceeded 37 pitches since the first three appearances of his career in 2012. ... 2B Josh Harrison was out of the lineup after \u201ca little stiffness in his back\u201d Friday, according to Martinez.", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-nationals/nats-get-lift-from-gomes-in-6-2-win-over-arizona", "date": "2021-04-18T03:31:00.000Z"}
