It felt good to just get that out of the way.\u201dIn 15 minutes, Griffin also added two rebounds and a block.\u201cIt was great to be back out there,\u201d Griffin added. \u201cI felt like it was a good start, but I\u2019ve got some room to improve obviously.\u201dTIP-INS:Wizards: Despite the loss, Washington took the season series 2-1, defeating the Nets 123-122 on Jan. 3 and 149-146 on Jan. 31.
