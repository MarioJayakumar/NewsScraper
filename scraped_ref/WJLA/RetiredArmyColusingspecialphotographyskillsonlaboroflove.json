{"title": "Retired Army Col. using special photography skills on 'labor of love'", "body": "Most people when they hit 82 years old they enjoy retirement and take a slower pace.  That would not be true for retired Army Colonel Duane Lempke.  He is still working as an aerial photographer.  He routinely climbs aboard a helicopter snapping amazing pictures from above.  \u201cI\u2019ve always been a serious amateur,\u201d  he jokes while describing some of the projects he\u2019s had the good fortune to work on.  Aerial\u2019s of the Capitol, MGM, the Wharf, but one project was near and dear to his heart.  Photographing the construction of the National Museum of the United States Army.  \u201cI photographed this area.  Before it got started?  Before it started when it was nothing but woods.\u201d  Lempke flew over the construction project every month taking dozens of pictures watching the build take place.  \u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime, labor of love really is what it amounts to.  To be able to photograph it from the air for three years\u201d When it was done he took pictures from the air, ground and inside after the displays went up.  So many pictures that he just published a book with all the best pictures.  Col. Lempke and millions of others who have served in our Nation\u2019s oldest and largest military branch have patiently waiting for a home that would tell the Army\u2019s story of glory and sacrifice. If you get to the new museum make sure to check out the gift shop and look for the Colonel\u2019s book, because then you\u2019ll get a rare chance to see history in the making with this museum.
