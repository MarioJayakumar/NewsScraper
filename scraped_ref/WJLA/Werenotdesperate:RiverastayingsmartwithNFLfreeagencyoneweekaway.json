{"title": "'We're not desperate': Rivera staying smart with NFL free agency one week away", "body": "The Washington Football Team is in a great position to come away with some talented players.They have the salary cap space. They have the money.But as head coach Ron Rivera told ABC7 sports anchor Scott Abraham on Wednesday the team will be smart about the process.\u201cI think it\u2019s really about going forward, thinking about what we have to do and what we have to control as we go into the future. We\u2019re not desperate. There\u2019s no immediate need to have to, got to, must,\u201d Rivera told Abraham. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to do is we\u2019re looking to build a winning, sustainable culture. We want to put the football team together the right way. A lot of good things happened last year. We did something that was a little unexpected, which I acknowledged.\"Rivera continued, \"But at the same time, just because of that, I really don\u2019t think you throw the plan away and you start reaching and doing things you don\u2019t need to do right now. I think what you do is you continue to put the pieces of the puzzle in place, and hopefully build it the right way and put it together the way you need it to be.\u201dThe big question is the quarterback situation. Alex Smith is gone. Washington has a couple of young quarterbacks on the roster in Taylor Heinicke and Kyle Allen. You would think Washington would be in the market for a veteran quarterback. Rivera though not showing his cards.\u201cWell, the biggest thing guys is we\u2019re going to continue to look. We\u2019re going through this process. Free agency starts next week. The draft is in 50 days, I understand. We still have time,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to explore all the options that are out there. I get it, you guys want answers, but we don\u2019t have answers for you right now because we\u2019re still working through the process. Again, we\u2019ve got a lot of time. It\u2019s free agency next week and the draft in 50 days.\u201dAnd in that time a lot of these questions should be answered. A division title last year was nice, but Rivera and company clearly want to build a consistent winner for many years to come.", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-football-team/nfl-free-agency-officially-one-week-away", "date": "2021-03-10T20:42:59.000Z"}
