Reyes officially signed with the team on Tuesday. He had been training at the IMG Academy in Florida as part of the International Pathway Program.\"I\u2019ve been training for the past 10 weeks with IMG in Florida with the NFL\u2019s International Pathway Program. Besides an additional week in high school, that\u2019s all the organized football learning that I have done. It\u2019s been those 10 weeks. I think it was a very condensed 10 weeks,\" Reyes told media over Zoom.Reyes, who was born in Chile, and has not been playing Football for long. He came out of high school in hopes of being in the NBA one day but decided to make the transition to Football after he left college, and when he went to the University of  Florida's pro day, Washington made sure to pick him up. \u201cI feel ready. Even though I haven\u2019t been playing the sport, I\u2019ve been training for this my whole life. I came to this country when I was 14 with the dream of making the NBA. I made the wrong decision back then [laughs]. I should\u2019ve been playing Football, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time. We didn\u2019t play Football in Chile.\"Football was not on Reyes mind for long. He played two seasons of college basketball at Tulane and thought the NBA would be his next step before he decided to make the  transition to Football.This is not the first time a division I basketball player has made the transition to Football. To name a few, Antonio Gates, Tony Gonzalez and Jimmy Graham all decided to stop their basketball careers and make the transition to Football.\"I know there are people, and I have followed their stories. Without them, I probably wouldn\u2019t have this big of a shot because there hasn\u2019t been a road. The road has been traveled by guys that made the transition from basketball to Football. I have to just thank them for making this possible for the next guys. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s new. It\u2019s something that has been proven to work. It\u2019s just required to be a guy that\u2019s ready to put in the work, and that\u2019s me. I\u2019m ready.\u201dIf Reyes makes the 53-man roster, he will be the first Chilean born athlete to do so.\"I have been living here alone since I was 14 just trying to make something of my life because Chile is a place where we don\u2019t have many opportunities. I came from a very poor family with a very humbling background. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money. When I first came to the States, my dad was able to send me 50 dollars a month for the first four years. You can only imagine how hard it was. When I first came here, I didn\u2019t know English. I didn\u2019t know a single word. I couldn\u2019t tell you a single thing. Now, getting that call and having that special moment\u2014we were at the gym sitting on the ground doing abs or something. My agent, Tabatha, called me and said the deal was done. I was like: \u2018OK, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t care about any other deal that comes on the table. I want to be in Washington.\"", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-football-team/sammis-reyes-goes-from-division-i-basketball-player-to-signing-with-the-wft", "date": "2021-04-14T21:11:13.000Z"}
