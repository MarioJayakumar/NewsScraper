My roles will be filled by others from the Broadway community and in a number of cases, from the roster of participants already in place on those shows,\" Rudin said in a statement.The move comes more than a week after The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s  contained accounts of the producing heavyweight throwing glass bowls, staples and baked potatoes at former employees. In his statement Saturday he did not deny the allegations.\u201cMuch has been written about my history of troubling interactions with colleagues, and I am profoundly sorry for the pain my behavior caused to individuals, directly and indirectly. I am now taking steps that I should have taken years ago to address this behavior,\u201d he said.The revelations in The Hollywood Reporter also prompted the performers\u2019 unions SAG-AFTRA, Actors Equity and the American Federation of Musicians Local 802 to come together condemn illegal harassment and harassment that creates a toxic work environment for entertainment employees.The revelations also prompted Tony Award-winner Karen Olivo to pull out of returning to \u201cMoulin Rouge! The Musical\u201d once it reopens. There are also plans for a protest March on Broadway on Wednesday, with stops at both Rudin\u2019s office as well as the Winter Garden Theatre, where Rudin is producing the Broadway revival of \u201cThe Music Man.\" There's also a campaign to persuade Actors\u2019 Equity Association to add Rudin to a Do Not Work list.In addition to \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d Rudin's current slate of Broadway shows includes \u201cThe Book of Mormon,\u201d \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d and a revival of \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d It was unclear if Rudin would also step back from producing films, which includes the upcoming \u201cThe Humans\u201d and \u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth.\u201dIn his statement, Rudin mentioned the upcoming reopening of Broadway after the  shuttered theaters for more than a year. He said he did not want to \u201cinterrupt\u201d the work ahead.\"My passionate hope and expectation is that Broadway will reopen successfully very soon, and that the many talented artists associated with it will once again begin to thrive and share their artistry with the world. I do not want any controversy associated with me to interrupt Broadway\u2019s well deserved return, or specifically, the return of the 1,500 people working on these shows.\u201d", "url": "https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/scott-rudin-will-step-back-after-allegations-of-bullying", "date": "2021-04-17T16:11:07.000Z"}
