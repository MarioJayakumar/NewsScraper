{"title": "ABC7 Salutes Sen. Bob Dole for his service - and his new endeavor", "body": "He\u2019s a Veteran, a politician, a Patriot, a War Hero, and now at 97-years-old, Senator Bob Dole has taken on a new role - Chair of the Honor Flight Association Ambassadors Program.On a zoom interview, Senator Dole expressed his happiness accepting this new endeavor. \u201cHonor Flight is a great program and I understand it\u2019s going to be continued next year. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to go down for one flight to say goodbye.\u201dFor years, Senator Dole has been at the World War Two Memorial greeting Veterans who come to visit aboard an Honor Flight. The organization brings 20,000 Veterans a year at no cost to the Veterans to the World War 2 Memorial. Dole shared with me he so enjoys greeting the Veterans. Shaking their hands, getting his picture taken with them, and sharing stories about their service. When he was Senate Majority Leader years ago, Dole helped raise nearly 300 million dollars to get this Memorial built. He along with Fed Ex Chairman Fred Smith saw to it that this Memorial was designed and constructed with all private money.When he was a young man, Bob Dole served with the 10th Mountain Division in Italy where he was wounded. He nearly died in his recovery from injection and he lost the use of one of his arms, but he says that didn\u2019t stop him. He told me it made him appreciation his life, and the working parts of his body.During our interview I asked the Senator how he wanted people to think of him years from now. He shared how he would like to be remembered as a Patriot, a Politician who served with honor, and not necessarily a spectacular man, but a pretty darn good one.", "url": "https://wjla.com/features/abc7-salutes/abc7-salutes-sen-bob-dole-for-his-service-and-his-new-endeavor", "date": "2020-12-19T02:23:38.000Z"}
