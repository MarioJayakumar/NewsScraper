I was sleeping because of night shift and my whole family woke me up,\u201d Dell\u2019Isola told Abraham. \u201cThey saw me on NHL Twitter and it was amazing. It\u2019s honoring people that a lot of times get forgotten, but it\u2019s not the best way to be remembered with crazy times like this, but I think it\u2019s great.\u201dVanecek actually helped break the news to Dani, recording a video message. You could say Christmas came early for the diehard Caps fan.\u201cIt was amazing to be honored with him,\u201d Dell\u2019Isola said. \u201cEven though we are nowhere near the same level, it was so cool to get a shout-out from him.\u201dDani started her nursing career in February 2020, right at the start of the pandemic. She quickly learned how to remain safe during this crisis while caring for others in need.\u201cIt\u2019s been a very good learning experience especially for even seasoned nurses, this is the first time that we\u2019ve experienced this in a long, long time,\u201d Dell\u2019Isola said. \u201cStarting out as a nurse, it was tough but once you got used to it, and we have a great team at MedStar. It has made me a better nurse in my first year of nursing.\u201dHockey is her favorite sport. She loves her Washington Capitals. Even her parents got engaged during a Caps game. Dani certainly has a lot of stress with her job in the ER, but the Caps always seem to put a smile on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s been a nice little thing to have to come home from work or to be at work to be cheering them on in the break room. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re able to get the season started,\u201d Dell\u2019Isola said. \u201cI do miss going to Caps game, cheering them on in person. With everything going on, I\u2019m just glad I can see them on TV and cheer them on from home. I hope we keep winning, I want the Cup again. It\u2019s all I want. I think we can do it, we have a great team.\u201d", "url": "https://wjla.com/sports/washington-capitals/dc-er-nurse-honored-by-caps-nhl", "date": "2021-02-02T21:42:54.000Z"}
