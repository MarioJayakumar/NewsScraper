Since COVID-19 vaccine distribution began in the United States on Dec. 14, more than 189 million doses have been administered, fully vaccinating over 74 million people or 22.3% of the total U.S. population.

Each state has its own plan for how to get those vaccines out to its residents \u2014 through county health offices, hospital systems, pharmacies, mass vaccination sites and mobile clinics \u2014 and some states are making more efficient use of their supplies than others.The federal government has started to play a larger role in distribution by sending vaccines directly to some pharmacy chains, community health centers and Federal Emergency Management Agency-supported sites.
