He also spent a month in Libya reporting riveting stories in the most difficult of circumstances as NATO bombs fell on Tripoli. He was honored with the 2011 Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize from WBUR and Boston University for that coverage of the Arab Spring.His voice became familiar to NPR listeners from his four years covering the White House. Covering former President George W. Bush's second term, David spent hours in NPR's booth in the basement of the West Wing and reporting on White House visits to places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Rwanda, Uruguay \u2013 and, of course, Crawford, Texas. He was an integral part of NPR's coverage of the historic 2008 election, reporting on Hillary Clinton's campaign from start to finish, and also focusing on how racial attitudes were playing into voters' decisions. The White House Correspondents' Association took special note of his report on a speech by then-candidate Barack Obama addressing the nation's racial divide and awarded it the Association's 2008 Merriman Smith Award for deadline coverage of the presidency.
