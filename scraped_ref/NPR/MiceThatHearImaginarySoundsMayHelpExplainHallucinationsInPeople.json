So the team came up with a system to detect when a mouse, or a person, was perceiving something that wasn't really there.\"We set up basically a computer game, an audio game, by which we could actually measure hallucination-like events,\" he says.Players \u2013 whether rodent or human \u2014 had to detect a particular sound that was nearly obscured by background noise. People clicked a button when they thought they heard the sound, mice moved their noses toward an expected reward. In this sort of test, the brain starts to anticipate hearing the sound, Kepecs says. That's helpful, he says, if you are, say, trying to listen for your name in a noisy restaurant.\"You can imagine, though, that if you are using a little bit too much of your expectations, suddenly your perceptions can be truly divorced from reality,\" he says.In the experiment, that's what happened to both people and mice. As they tried to hear the actual sound, both species became more likely to respond to sounds that existed only in their minds.The likelihood of a false response respond was closely tied to levels of a substance in the brain called dopamine, Kepecs says. An increase in dopamine in an area called the striatum indicated that a false perception was about to occur.\"What we believe is happening is that baseline dopamine levels are setting the balance between the current sensory evidence that's coming in, the sounds, and our prior expectations,\" Kepecs says.With too much dopamine, your brain starts hearing things that aren't there.That makes sense because many studies have found a link between dopamine levels and hallucinations, including those caused by schizophrenia and drugs for schizophrenia are thought to work by blocking the effects of dopamine.The team's success in inducing false perceptions appears to offer a better way to use mice to learn precisely what dopamine is doing in the brain, and to test experimental drugs meant to prevent hallucination.\"And when you've made discoveries there, you go back to the patients,\" Simpson says.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/01/983556852/mice-that-hear-imaginary-sounds-may-help-explain-hallucinations-in-people", "date": "P2M,50S"}
