After he was  on Wednesday, veterans  to the New York Islanders later that night.After making the playoffs during his rookie season in 2017-18, Hischier has now seen the Devils go through three straight trade deadlines as sellers. The results on the ice have dictated the front office\u2019s moves to continue loading up for future seasons, and Hischier understands that thinking.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s frustration. I\u2019m 100% behind this organization, and I trust the process, I know what guys we have,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not easy to lose two big players from your team. But this opens up other opportunities. There are players want to take those opportunities and have the chance to do that. I trust the guys that are still here. Even if you\u2019re a young team, we can be competitive and win some games.\u201dWith Palmieri and Zajac gone, the Devils\u2019 roster is littered with younger forwards. Andreas Johnsson is the oldest among the group at 26. Despite being just 22 years old, Hischier has played more NHL games than all but three forwards \u2014 Miles Wood, Pavel Zacha and Jesper Bratt.As the NHL\u2019s youngest captain, the responsibility of leading that inexperienced group for the rest of this season and beyond will fall largely on Hischier\u2019s shoulders. Part of that is just getting back on the ice.\u201cI have big motivation. I\u2019ve played five games this year, so I just want to play some games,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cI want to be out there battling with the team ,and obviously we want to win games and be a competitive team and learn. And I want to go out there do my best, like I\u2019ve always tried, to just be a good teammate.\u201dEven when Hischier was out of the lineup with his injuries, he attempted to spend as much time around the team as possible. He attended meetings, talked with players and coaches, and leant support in any way he could.When the Devils appointed Hischier captain in February, there was clear understanding he wasn\u2019t alone on an island. The Devils had other veteran leaders to help him along.Two of those support pillars in Zajac and Palmieri are now gone, though Hischier said he doesn\u2019t view his role any differently.\u201cWhen I got the C, I said I\u2019ve got guys in the room like (Zajac, Palmieri), they kind of helped me out. But that doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cThere are still guys in the locker room that can help me out that have a lot of experience. At the end of the day, I\u2019ll try just to be who I am and not change anything.\u201dGoing through another trade deadline, Hischier said there\u2019s no way to get used to saying goodbye to valued teammates. There\u2019s a fresh sting each time it happens.Hischier understands the business aspect of those moves, and he said they\u2019re also being made for the good of the future of the franchise. Now it\u2019s on the players to fulfill that potential.\u201cWhere we\u2019re at right now, I still obviously trust in the process of what we\u2019re doing, the way we playing like, who we have in the locker room,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cI 100% trust the process we\u2019re doing right now. And for me, the focus is just going back out there and get some games in with my teammates.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/on-his-shoulders-now-devils-nico-hischier-on-the-trade-deadline-and-his-role-as-captain-to-lead-the-team-back-to-relevancy.html", "date": "2021-04-11161814060054507:30:00"}
