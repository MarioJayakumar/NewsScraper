Will the  finally return to the playoffs in 2021?They last made it in 2016. And that\u2019s their only playoff appearance since the 2011 season, when they won their most recent Super Bowl.Since 2016, the Giants have won three, five, four, and six games. But do they have playoff potential next season?\u201cIn the NFC East? Everybody has potential,\u201d former NFL head coach Brian Billick told NJ Advance Media. \u201cBasically, the division sucks. But it\u2019s going to get better. With the qualifier that they\u2019re in the NFC East, yeah, they\u2019ve got as good of a chance of making the playoffs as anybody. Does that mean they\u2019re good? I don\u2019t know about that.\u201dLast year, the Giants almost won the division at 6-10. They would\u2019ve won it if the  had beaten Washington in the regular season finale.Instead, Washington won that game and captured the division, with a 7-9 record. The Cowboys also went 6-10 last season, while the Eagles finished 4-11-1.Billick said the NFC East \u201cshould be wide open\u201d again in 2021, when the NFL\u2019s regular season schedule expands from 16 to 17 games.So with that in mind, as you reflect on free agency and prepare for the 2021 NFL Draft, let\u2019s take a look at our latest NFC East power rankings:  is back. And even if he\u2019s not fully healthy immediately, coming off that scary ankle injury, the Cowboys have by far the most proven quarterback in this division \u2014 a low bar to clear. That counts for a lot, even if Mike McCarthy isn\u2019t a great head coach. Prescott\u2019s massive contract extension was the Cowboys\u2019 biggest move in free agency. But they clearly have the NFC East\u2019s best overall roster, especially with a healthy Prescott.Quarterback uncertainty here, with Alex Smith and Dwayne Haskins gone and Ryan Fitzpatrick arriving. But Washington has the division\u2019s best defense. It finished third last season in \u2019 ratings, with edge rushers Chase Young and Montez Sweat leading the way. They combined for 16.5 sacks and 32 quarterback hits \u2014 Young as a rookie, Sweat as a second-year pro. They\u2019ll be a dangerous duo for years to come. A lot depends on  taking the next step in Year 3. And a lot of that hinges on Saquon Barkley returning to pre-injury form. And on that shaky offensive line progressing. And on actually playing like a true No. 1 wide receiver. The Giants have a lot of \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d on offense. Defensively, their secondary should be better than last year, presuming  stays healthy and provides a steady presence at No. 2 cornerback, opposite James Bradberry. Jackson will be targeted often. Rebuilding time. They traded away  and are rolling with second-year quarterback  \u2014 for now. The Eagles have a ton of question marks, as they come off  dysfunctional final season. And on offense, Hurts isn\u2019t the only major uncertainty. New head coach, the Colts\u2019 former offensive coordinator, is completely unproven. Don\u2019t expect the Eagles to come anywhere close to contending in 2021.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/04/giants-hope-for-playoffs-in-2021-basically-the-division-sucks-says-ex-nfl-coach-nfc-east-power-rankings-after-free-agency.html", "date": "2021-04-16161856990047706:45:00"}
