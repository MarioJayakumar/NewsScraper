With the days dwindling on the way to the first round, NJ Advance Media reached out to \u2019s  to get some insight on the Eagles\u2019 outlook during draft weekend.During our conversation, Easterling provided his perspective on the Eagles\u2019 options at No. 12, some under-the-radar cornerbacks and more. \u201cI think it starts with the two Alabama wide receivers, DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle. If either of them is still on the board at 12 -- and I think there\u2019s a strong chance at least one of them is -- it would be a home-run selection at that spot. That could also be a good spot for a top corner, if either Alabama\u2019s Patrick Surtain II or South Carolina\u2019s Jaycee Horn is still there. If they\u2019re comfortable with the medicals, Virginia Tech\u2019s Caleb Farley is also worthy of consideration there. If Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons is still on the board, he could be a huge steal.\u201d\u201cThere are two undersized guys I think could be great values on Day 2. The first one that comes to mind will be familiar to Eagles fans, Florida State\u2019s Asante Samuel Jr., as well as Washington\u2019s Elijah Molden. They are first-round prospects in every area except height/weight, so if teams looking for bigger corners let them fall, they could end up being bargains for teams that don\u2019t mind smaller cover guys who still get the job done at a high level. Another intriguing guy I like in that range is South Carolina\u2019s Israel Mukuamu, who has a rare combination of size (6-3, 205), length and ball skills.\u201d\u201cMy favorite guy in that range is Wake Forest\u2019s Jamie Newman. If you\u2019re spending a Day 3 pick on a quarterback, it\u2019s all about traits and potential, and Newman has plenty of both. He had some consistency issues in college, but he\u2019s an extremely talented guy who could easily be the steal of this year\u2019s QB class if he lands in the right place. Newman had transferred to Georgia for the 2020 season, but opted out due to COVID-19.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Louisiana Tech\u2019s Milton Williams, who is versatile, athletic and explosive. He\u2019s a guy who should probably go in the first two rounds, but if he\u2019s available anytime after that, it would be a huge win for whoever gets him. He\u2019s got all the tools to quickly develop into a difference-maker. If you\u2019re looking for a bigger, more nose-tackle kind of guy, North Carolina State\u2019s Alim McNeill is my favorite value pick there.\u201d Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/eagles/2021/04/nfl-draft-2021-who-are-best-4-options-for-eagles-at-no-12-which-quarterback-is-a-late-round-steal-ask-the-expert.html", "date": "2021-04-17161865540147306:30:01"}
