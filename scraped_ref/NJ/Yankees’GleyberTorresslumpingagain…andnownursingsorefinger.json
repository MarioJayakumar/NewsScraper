The hope would be that he\u2019s back in the lineup (Wednesday).With Torres sidelined and utility infielder Tyler Wade optioned to the taxi squad last weekend, Boone executed his new emergency plan for shortstop by . This was Urshela\u2019s first regular-season game at shortstop since 2017 with the Cleveland Indians, but he saw some action at the position this spring.\u201cHe\u2019s played a lot of shortstop in his minor-league career, and even in the big-league level,\u201d Boone said of Urshela. \u201cObviously, he was a defense-first guy always, so (there\u2019s) really no reservation in throwing him over there. Especially with as much as we shift now, there\u2019s a handful of times he\u2019s standing at shortstop essentially playing the position every night on a given hitter or given situation.\u201dTorres, 24, hurt his finger in the second inning of Monday\u2019s game after working a leadoff walk against Blue Jays lefty starter Robbie Ray. Urshela followed to the plate, and with the count 1-1, Ray stepped off and make a pick-off throw to first. Torres had been leaning toward second, and while he dove head first back safely, he jammed his right ring finger hard into the bag.Torres finished the game, but had no success at the plate, going 0-for-3 with the second-inning walk and a strikeout.\u201cHe was pretty sore (Monday) night,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s still a little bit sore (Tuesday).\u201dTorres became the fourth Yankees\u2019 regular to miss games this season due to health issues, joining first baseman Luke Voit (knee surgery, IL), right fielder Aaron Judge (side soreness, missed 2 games) and Urshela (missed one game after COVID vaccine). Also, reliever Justin Wilson began the season on the IL and four others currently are on it besides Voit \u2014 third baseman Miguel Andujar (sore wrist), reliever Zack Britton (elbow surgery), and starting pitchers Luis Severino (Tommy John surgery rehab) and Clarke Schmidt (elbow strain).The rest day may do Torres good on several levels, as he\u2019s followed a down 2020 season by starting this season slowly. Playing the first 10 games, he hit just .205 with no homers and one RBI. He\u2019s also already made two errors after posting a .941 fielding percentage last season that was the lowest among qualifying shortstops.Torres also struggled at the plate last season, batting .243 with three homers and 16 RBI in 42 games.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/yankees-gleyber-torres-slumping-again-and-now-nursing-sore-hand.html", "date": "2021-04-13161835296218518:29:22"}
