{"title": "Gerrit Cole reacts to Aaron Boone reaming out Yankees, slow start to season", "body": "Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole says his manager's postgame airing out on players was impactful. ace  has witnessed some good manager tirades during team meetings in his day. He heard them when he began his career in the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 organization and later when he was with the Houston Astros.Cole witnessed another doozy late Friday night after the Yankees dropped to 5-8 for the season with a homestand-beginning,  to the Tampa Bay Rays. after the game and chewed his players out.\u201cI haven\u2019t played with Aaron quite as much as some of the other players,\u201d Cole said before Saturday\u2019s Yankees-Rays\u2019 game at Yankee Stadium. \u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly been reamed out by a few managers in my day. It was pretty par for the course from what I\u2019ve seen in my experience in the big leagues. I think the players listen to (Boone), and I think it was impactful.\u201dCole hopes Boone\u2019s stern message sparks the Yankees.\u201cIt\u2019s just like any feedback,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s honest. It\u2019s truthful. It\u2019s not always pretty. Sometimes you need to hear it.\u201dHere is Cole\u2019s take on the Yankees\u2019 poor start:\u201cI think there\u2019s a handful of different variables, the first one being that baseball is a hard game. A lot of times when everything\u2019s going well it can seem easy. And when everything\u2019s not going well, it can dumbfound you at the same time. I think it is early and we all were looking to settle in.\u201cA streak like this after two or three months of really solid baseball will get overlooked, but we don\u2019t have that backdrop right now. We\u2019re kind of scuffling here and we\u2019re starting off the season with a less than ideal record. It is what it is, and we\u2019ll take it one game at a time and keep trying to improve.\u201dCole is one of the few Yankees players who can\u2019t be blamed. He\u2019ll take a 2-0 record and 1.47 ERA through three outings into his Sunday start against Tampa Bay.\u201cWhether one pitcher is performing well or two pitchers are performing well and other pitchers aren\u2019t, we win and lose together as a team,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe pitch as a unit. We pitch as a group, with the bullpen included. As an ace \u2014 just as a teammate in general \u2014 the conversations that you have are always trying to get your peers better, whether things are going really well or things aren\u2019t going the way you would expect them to go.\u201cBe encouraging to teammates and try to find little ways to get better, whether it be better pitch selection, better execution, better mindset or maybe a little mechanical change. There\u2019s always something to offer every single day we show up to the park.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/gerrit-cole-reacts-to-aaron-boone-reaming-out-yankees-slow-start-to-season.html", "date": "2021-04-17161867619012612:16:30"}
