{"title": "Rutgers QB Artur Sitkowski enters transfer portal", "body": " roller-coaster  career has come to a close.The quarterback and Old Bridge native has entered the NCAA transfer portal. He has three years of eligibility remaining and will be able to play immediately at his next stop after the NCAA granted all athletes a one-time free transfer earlier this week.Sitkowski was a heralded recruit under former coach Chris Ash and started 11 games during a disastrous freshman season in 2018 where he threw a nation-leading 18 interceptions. He lost the starting job to transfer McLane Carter in 2019, then appeared in three games before opting to redshirt following Ash\u2019s firing. Sitkowski briefly entered the transfer portal at the end of that season, . He then lost a preseason battle to transfer Noah Vedral last fall, but ended up coming off the bench to help lead the Scarlet Knights to two of their three wins.The move is not a surprise, but the timing is. The actions and comments by Schiano and offensive coordinator Sean Gleeson . That reality combined with the NCAA\u2019s recent legislation and  set the stage for Sitkowski to eventually move on. But it is a tad unexpected he is doing so before the start of spring practice -- Rutgers will end its  pause next week -- rather than after going through the spring.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/2021/04/rutgers-qb-artur-sitkowski-enters-transfer-portal.html", "date": "2021-04-16161861810444320:08:24"}
