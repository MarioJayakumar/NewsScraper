{"title": "Friday was the Devils\u2019 1st real test for life without Travis Zajac | 3 observations from loss to Penguins", "body": "New Jersey Devils goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood (29) stops a shot by Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby (87) during the first period of an NHL hockey game Friday, April 9, 2021, in Newark, N.J.The Devils had the chance to sweep their first back-to-back set of the season, but the Pittsburgh Penguins used a pair of power-play goals to build a lead before snuffing out a late Devils rally in a 6-4 win on Friday at Prudential Center in Newark.Here are some observations from the game:Whenever the Devils hosted the Penguins in recent seasons, a predictable sequence played out multiple times during each meeting. Sidney Crosby would step onto the ice, and  would follow right behind him.Against the future hall of famer, the Devils always countered with their best two-way center. But on Friday, that wasn\u2019t an option.Following , the Devils needed to find a new way to defend Crosby without Zajac. It ended up being Jack Hughes\u2019 line that matched up the most against Crosby at 5-on-5. Hughes played 6:36 against him, with line mates Yegor Sharangovich and Janne Kuokkanen coming in a little under that total.\u201cThat\u2019s our future right there. That\u2019s the guys that we need to have to be able to go head-to-head against a lot of good players in the league, and I tried not to shy away from it,\u201d head coach Lindy Ruff said. \u2018I thought the matchup, the speed from both lines was good. We knew they would get some opportunities, but at the same time I knew that our lines would get some opportunities. We again missed some great opportunities, and we finished on one of them. But when you look at the age difference, experience difference, I loved what our young guys did.\u201d In the matchup between the Hughes and Crosby lines, Crosby scored the only 5-on-5 goal while the two were matched up. When Hughes scored in the second period, Crosby wasn\u2019t on the ice, and Crosby\u2019s two assists came on two Penguins power plays. Since the Devils have last change when they\u2019re the home team, they can control the matchups much easier at Prudential Center. They still have three road games left against the Penguins this season, so they won\u2019t always get the matchups they want against Crosby in those.When those road games are played, other players will need to handle that test.\u201cHe\u2019s probably is the best player in the world, certainly tough not having Trav here, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s next man up,\u201d forward Miles Wood said. \u201cI feel confident in the group that we have. It\u2019s a great opportunity for the young group to step up and play against a world class talent like that and see what we can bring.\u201dThe Devils have slightly altered how they deploy their power-play units in recent games. For most of the season, the two groups typically saw a 50-50 split. One would play for about a minute, and the second would come on for the final minute of a two-minute advantage.The Penguins gave the Devils just one power play on Tuesday, and Jack Hughes, Ty Smith, Jesper Bratt, Pavel Zacha and Andreas Johnsson played the entire two minutes. The Devils didn\u2019t score on it, but they maintained possession in the offensive zone for nearly the entire thing, posting four shots.\u201cWe were gonna try to ride one unit a lot more tried to give them 1:20, 1:30. But the unit has done such a good job for the most part,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cWe looked at where the numbers were and just had some conversations and decided that maybe giving five guys the bulk may generate some better opportunities, and I think it has for us.\u201dThere will be some instances where the second power-play unit still gets ice time, and it just didn\u2019t happen on Friday since the Devils had only one man advantage. Ruff also said when Nico Hischier returns to the lineup, he expects him to take Johnsson\u2019s spot as the net-front guy on that top unit.Before not scoring on Friday, the power play generated three goals in the previous two games. So Ruff might be onto something about giving one group more time to generate things.\u201cThey wanted to try it out a little bit and give us a little more time out there,\u201d Bratt said. \u201cSo for the last couple of games, we\u2019ve been doing a good job on the power play and especially winning our battles and stuff. Those first couple of seconds to win the battles and be close to support each other. That really makes a better way to tire out to PK, and that\u2019s usually when the chances open up more.\u201dThere are still a couple days left before the NHL trade deadline on Monday, so it\u2019s possible another player or two ends up getting moved. Regardless of what happens in that regard, expect the Devils to start giving some AHL players a chance to get a taste of the NHL down the stretch.\u201cI do anticipate. Usually that happens this time of year when we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re in,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cI saw a lot of the games, almost every game that they\u2019ve had (in Newark) so there\u2019ll be an opportunity probably for other young guys to get a feel for what it\u2019s like.\u201d Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/friday-was-the-devils-1st-real-test-for-life-without-travis-zajac-3-observations-from-loss-to-penguins.html", "date": "2021-04-10161805583876007:57:18"}
