{"title": "They risk their lives nursing grandma through COVID. Now they can\u2019t afford health care | Editorial", "body": "Nursing home staffers are still falling ill at an alarming rate in New Jersey. There were 4,117 such workers with coronavirus as of Friday, which is actually more than the number of residents currently afflicted in those long-term care facilities. More than 17,500 have recovered, but 143 have died.As much as any other profession, these caregivers have faced fear, anxiety, and tragedy, so imagine what it\u2019s like to show up for work to learn that your nursing home\u2019s new owner has pulled the plug on your pension plan, slashed your paid time off, and made your company health plan impossible to afford.Wait, run back that last part: Yes,  through the worst public health crisis in a century, people with perhaps the most dangerous jobs in the country, cannot afford health insurance themselves.That is the grim reality for nearly 300 union members \u2014 certified nursing assistants (CNAs), housekeepers, laundry workers, dietary and recreation staff, and some nurses \u2014 whose five workplaces were recently bought out by Complete Care, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in the state. They had a contract with Genesis Healthcare, the previous employer, but new ownership does not have to abide by it \u2013 it only has to recognize the union (1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers), implement \u201cinitial terms,\u201d and then enter negotiations for new terms that could last years. on our nursing home industry \u2014 beyond examining the horrid circumstances which led to the loss of 8,000 residents and workers \u2014 there it is. It needs to take a deep dive on the plight of poverty-wage workers whose careers have taken this Orwellian backflip, because even in union shops, they are .The concessions forced on them by Complete Care at the five facilities are not uncommon following sales. In this case, the pension plan has been eliminated, replaced with a 401(k) that no longer includes employer contributions. The number of paid holidays has been reduced.And worst of all, the medical plan is no longer affordable: A biweekly premium for an employee and spouse has been raised to $261, with the family premium hiked to $399. That is way out of reach for the average CNA making $14 or $15 per hour, which drives them to NJ FamilyCare and puts their insurance burden on the taxpayer.\u201cSo they are health care workers who will now become health care wards of the state,\u201d says Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), the chairman of the Senate Health Committee. \u201cThe new employers don\u2019t care that these people put their lives on the line every day to feed their families. These companies thank them by taking away their affordable coverage, which means everything to them.\u201dThe CEO for the private-equity company that owns Complete Care, Sam Stein of  in Howell, asserts that his group saved 1,500 jobs that were in jeopardy because of the \u201cprecarious finances\u201d of Genesis, the previous owner.\u201cWe recognize that change can be difficult and our experienced leadership team is committed to providing a smooth transition for both residents and staff,\u201d Stein stated in an email. \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits and are known as a great place to work.\u201dWhen those workers aren\u2019t falling ill and dying, that might be the case.It\u2019s not enough to praise our essential workers \u2014 we have to protect and pay them.But Vitale and industry experts have long suspected that private equity owners prioritize profit over care. , points out that \u201cthese firms focus on extracting as much profit as possible from nursing home care. Simply put, when nursing homes are depleted of resources, vulnerable residents suffer.\u201dStudies support that. The University of Chicago just released a report that showed patients in private-equity owned homes had a 1.7 percent higher chance of dying during their stay or 90 days after leaving, which translates to over the 12-year period of study. Here in New Jersey, a study of the COVID rate at for-profit homes found it was than the statewide average.So when  begin in May or June, he said they will focus not only on pandemic response, but also \u201cthe performance of for-profit homes, standards of care, operational integrity, living conditions, patient outcomes \u2014 and, their treatment of staff.\u201dIncluded in that, he adds, is how employers cut benefits to make a facility more attractive to the next buyer. That is not the way to treat people who do backbreaking work for meager wages, with an injury rate higher than that of construction workers and a burnout rate that is literally 100 percent.
