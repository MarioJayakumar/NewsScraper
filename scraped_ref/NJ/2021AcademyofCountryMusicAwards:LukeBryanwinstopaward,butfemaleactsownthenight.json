Maren Morris won two honors, including song of the year. Miranda Lambert performed three times and held onto her record as the most decorated winner in ACM history. And Mickey Guyton, the first Black woman to host the awards show, gave a powerful, top-notch vocal performance.Though female country stars didn\u2019t compete for the night\u2019s top prize \u2013 Luke Bryan was named entertainer of the year \u2013 they owned Sunday\u2019s ACM Awards.Underwood\u2019s performance stood out the most. She was joined by gospel legend CeCe Winans and the dynamic duo blended their voices like angels onstage. Underwood performed songs from her recent gospel hymns album \u201cMy Savior,\u201d kicking off the set with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and \u201cGreat Is Thy Faithfulness.\u201d Then Winans joined in, matching her strong vocal performance.Lambert performed three times, first alongside rock-pop singer Elle King for a fun, energetic performance of their new duet \u201cDrunk (And I Don\u2019t Wanna Go Home).\u201d Lambert, who founded pet shelter nonprofit MuttNation, also performed alongside album of the year winner Chris Stapleton for \u201cMaggie\u2019s Song,\u201d a tribute to Stapleton\u2019s dog who died 2019. Her final performance was with Jack Ingram and Jon Randall.The performances that aired Sunday were pre-taped at various locations in Nashville, Tennessee, including the Grand Ole Opry House, the Ryman Auditorium and The Bluebird Cafe. Winners, wearing masks, accepted awards in real time in front of small audiences made up of medical and health care workers.Bryan was set to perform Sunday but backed out of the show because he recently tested positive for the coronavirus.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I could not be there,\u201d he said from Los Angeles. \u201cAnd to all my fans out there and country radio, we miss touring. We\u2019ve missed being on the road with everybody that makes me an entertainer. My bus drivers, my band, my crew, what a challenging year. But to all the fans and everybody we\u2019ll be back out on the road doing what we love.\u201dMorris spoke about the taxing year without live music when she won female artist of the year.\u201cReally just happy to be in a category with women that were not able to tour this year, but brought so much heat to the game to country music this year. You\u2019ve inspired me so much to no end, and even in a year where no one\u2019s gotten to play shows, I have heard some of the best music out of all of you this past year. So thank you so much for inspiring me,\u201d she said.Collaborating onstage was the theme of the awards show, and Morris and hubby Ryan Hurd sang together, ending with a kiss. A teary-eyed Morris won song of the year for her Grammy-nominated hit \u201cThe Bones,\u201d which topped the country music charts for months last year.Morris lost single of the year, where all of the nominated songs were performed by female artists. Carly Pearce and Lee Brice\u2019s platinum duet, \u201cI Hope You\u2019re Happy Now,\u201d won the prize.\u201cWe wrote this song about my story and I guess it resonated with everybody,\u201d Pearce said onstage, also thanking busbee, who produced the song and died in late 2019. \u201cThis is the last song that my producer worked on.\u201dAnother tender moment came when Blanco Brown presented Old Dominion with group of the year. It marked Brown\u2019s first public appearance after suffering significant injuries in a head-on vehicle collision last year.But the entire three-hour show didn\u2019t go smoothly. The Grammy-winning duo Dan + Shay performed their latest hit, \u201cGlad You Exist,\u201d but the pre-taped moment aired out of sync.\u201cApparently there was an audio/video sync issue on the television broadcast,\u201d the duo tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019re bummed about it, but it happens, especially when performances are happening in multiple locations.\u201dAnother mishap occurred when Martina McBride announced the winner of single of the year. McBride correctly announced \u201cI Hope You\u2019re Happy Now\u201d though \u201cI Hope\u201d by Gabby Barrett appeared on the TV screen.Pearce and Brice\u2019s \u201cI Hope You\u2019re Happy Now\u201d also won musical event of the year, while Barrett was named new female artist of the year. Rhett won male artist of the year and Jimmie Allen was named new male artist of the year.Those acts performed Sunday, as did Alan Jackson, Lady A, Blake Shelton, Ashley McBryde, Brothers Osborne and Guyton, who gave an all-star performance of \u201cHold On\u201d during the show, which she hosted with Keith Urban. She recently had her first child and became the first Black solo woman nominated for a Grammy in the country category this year.Little Big Town also performed \u2014 but as a threesome. The Grammy winners sang \u201cWine, Beer, Whiskey\u201d without band member Phillip Sweet since he recently tested positive for COVID-19.Sweet and Bryan weren\u2019t the only country stars missing from the show. Morgan Wallen, whose latest album and singles have found major success on both the country and pop charts, was declared ineligible by the ACMs after he was caught on camera using a racial slur earlier this year.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2021/04/2021-academy-of-country-music-awards-luke-bryan-wins-top-award-but-female-acts-own-the-night.html", "date": "2021-04-19161880563691300:13:56"}
