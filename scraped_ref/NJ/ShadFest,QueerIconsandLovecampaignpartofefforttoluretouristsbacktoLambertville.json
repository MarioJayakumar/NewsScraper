{"title": "Shad Fest, Queer Icons and Love campaign part of effort to lure tourists back to Lambertville", "body": "The Greater Lambertville Chamber of Commerce is planning a number of promotions and activities to encourage visitors to come to the Delaware River town. The Delaware River Towns Chamber of Commerce to the , a move its leaders say is a reflection of what the organization\u2019s predominant goal will be as the  pandemic continues to negatively impact one of the most significant  in New Jersey.Jane Wesby, president of the Greater Lambertville Chamber of Commerce, explained that the name change was made roughly one month ago partially due to lack of funding as well as the fact that other municipalities the chamber previously served, including  and , have their own business organizations.The chamber and Lambertville have formed a more collaborative relationship over the last year as a result of the epidemic.\u201cWhen the pandemic started,  ... and in doing so we became more Lambertville-centric anyway,\u201d Wesby said. \u201cSo it just made sense to really laser focus on a place where we have more contacts, control and hopefully ability to make things happen.\u201dThe Love Our Shops was part of a 2020 marketing campaign.However, Cindy Kunnas, the chamber\u2019s executive director, emphasized that the organization will continue to support members from other communities regardless of the name change.\u201cWe still serve our members that are in Lumberville (in Pennsylvania) ... And we have members in Stockton because they don\u2019t have a business association,\u201d Kunnas said. \u201cSo we still continue to serve them, even the ones in Hew Hope \u2014 no matter where they are.\u201dThe chamber is still in the process of recruiting new members and solidifying its calendar of upcoming events. These events are being orchestrated in an effort to recuperate losses in tourism, which Wesby confirmed has resulted in the closure of a handful of businesses as well as less revenue being earned for the city though parking meters.These initiatives include erecting a \u2018welcome\u2019 banner across Bridge Street at the end of the month in addition to posting smaller flags around the city.Examples of the We Love Our Lambertville banners that will be hung across the city,\u201cIt\u2019s really just to beautify the town, and we\u2019ve seen other towns do it and it looked nice,\u201d Kunnas said.Stephen Harris, vice president of the chamber, is spearheading a campaign in which a series of videos spotlighting local business owners will soon be uploaded to the chamber\u2019s soon-to-be launched YouTube page.\u201cHarris worked with people to do videos of 13, 14 different merchants and those will go on our website,\u201d Wesby said. \u201cAlso there\u2019s a (\u201dLove Lambertville\u201d) film that was repurposed and narrated by a guy on PBS named , and ... we\u2019re going to release that at the same time too. So a big kick-off for the Greater Lambertville Chamber of Commerce.\u201dThe chamber is teaming up with the  in Frenchtown and  to launch an exhibit on May 1 called \u201cQueer Icons,\u201d which will be similar in nature to .Ten icons will be set up around New Hope, and 10 around Lambertville.Wesby and Kunnas said the exhibit will reflect the artistic history of Lambertville, as well as its identity as a hub for the LGBTQ+ community.\u201cYes, we\u2019re a food destination, yes, we\u2019re an antiques destination, but we have such a rich arts background here that if we could incorporate that as well and get people here again safely ... that that would be something that hasn\u2019t been tried before in terms of bringing people to town,\u201d Wesby said.Artwork in windows in Lambertville.\u201cWe really toss around different ideas, and try to figure out what works safely, what is affordable to do, what makes sense, and what people would be interested in coming out to see,\u201d Kunnas said. \u201cSo the Icons really show off that we are a LGBTQ+ community and that that culture is strong ... and it also helps educate people who may not be really familiar (with that).\u201dThe chamber is also working on producing an interactive map of Lambertville and New Hope in both English and Spanish so people can follow a self-guided tour that leads them to the location of each Icon.The organization is seeking to accumulate grant funds to launch a public arts program in Lambertville. The chamber is currently awaiting a decision on a grant applied for earlier this year that would fund a project by local eco-artist  who would produce maps of the Alexauken Creek by creating dyes made from invasive species in the community.The project would also include , a team that seeks to make Lambertville a more wildlife-friendly city, and , an organization that creates and advocates for trails, pathways and scenic corridors throughout Delaware.McManus hopes to also collaborate with students from thein Lambertville.\u201cThe ultimate goal of the whole project is that the work that gets created with the high school kids would get exhibited in a few storefront windows in downtown Lambertville over the course of a few months \u2014 during our busiest tourist season,\u201d McManus said.The chamber has rescheduled its biggest fundraiser, the city\u2019s annual Shad Fest, from April to October in light of the ongoing epidemic.While Wesby was hesitant to share specific details about this year\u2019s two-day extravaganza of artists, crafters, food and entertainment, she emphasized that the chamber is working harder than ever before this year to involve local businesses.\u201cWe want to engage our businesses. We know that they have felt disenfranchised at times. We want to make sure that does not happen,\u201d Wesby said. \u201cWe want to involve more locals in terms of different events that we will include.\u201dThe Chamber will also once again host the city\u2019s annual Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving, which Kunnas said she hopes will be able to be held in regular fashion this year.\u201cThe hope is that we can have an outdoor run,\u201d Kunnas said. \u201cMaybe possibly we can do an online component where you can run it wherever you want or you run it with us, but most people seem to want to get together to run instead of virtually pay to run around their neighborhood.\u201dDowntown Lambertville.Wesby said future plans continue to be subject to COVID restrictions.\u201cRight now New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania are contributing to more positive cases every day than any other place in the country,\u201d Wesby said. \u201cSo obviously we\u2019ll take a look at any event we\u2019re planning, and if there\u2019s a spike or a new variant or whatever, we\u2019ll have to back off.\u201cBut that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to do these outdoor interactive things; they seem to be COVID-proof.
