Just 2 \u00bd weeks since the slugger had a procedure to repair a partially torn left meniscus, he received good news Monday during a follow-up exam:He was cleared immediately to resume fielding drills. By next week, Voit may resume hitting off a tee.\u201cThat (exam) went really well,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said before Tuesday night\u2019s Yankees-Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 game in Dunedin, Fla. \u201cHe was actually doing some light fielding drills today in the cage. I think he\u2019s able to start throwing this week with the hopes that he\u2019ll start introducing hitting off the tee starting next week. So he\u2019s progressed really well to this point.\u201dThe Yankees are hopeful that Voit will be off the injured list and back in their lineup sometime in May.Voit led the majors with 22 homers (in 56 games) last season, but batted just .218 with no homers in 13 games this spring while dealing with nagging knee soreness. Voit played through the issue for most of spring training before opting to get checked out 10 days before the season opener. That\u2019s when the meniscus tear was discovered, and a decision quickly was made to have surgery.With Voit sidelined, has started nine of the Yanks\u2019 first 11 games at first base counting Tuesday. Through Monday, he was batting just .111 with two singles and one homer in 27 at-bats.\u201cThe first three or four games, there were a lot of really good at bats and important at-bats (for Bruce), a big homer, some walks in there,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI think it was just a few games where he wasn\u2019t getting real good swings off and not making great contact. Hopefully we\u2019ll get him going and back to contributing.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/yankees-luke-voit-speeding-along-in-rehab-from-knee-surgery.html", "date": "2021-04-13161835507160819:04:31"}
