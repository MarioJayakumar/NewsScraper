{"title": "A letter from a N.J. 6th grader made Black history a national issue. Meet the student who wrote it.", "body": "Ebele Azikiwe, 12, in Cherry Hill last month. Azikiwe testified in October at a state Assembly hearing, lending her support to legislation requiring New Jersey's school districts to add diversity to curriculums. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill into law. Ebele Azikiwe was in the sixth grade last year when February arrived, and it was time to learn about Black history again. She was familiar with the curriculum: Rosa Parks, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a discussion on slavery. Just like the year before, and the year before that, she said.Then came George Floyd\u2019s death in May, and she wrote to the administration at her school in Cherry Hill to ask for more than the same lessons.\u201cWe learned about slavery, but did we go into the roots of slavery?\u201d said Ebele, 12. \u201cYou learned about how they had to sail across, but did you learn about how they felt being tied down on those boats?\u201dHer letter went from the principal to the superintendent and then began to make headlines, leading to pledges to include fuller Black history courses.In the months since Floyd\u2019s killing in Minneapolis, educators say they\u2019ve heard a demand from students for fuller Black history lessons beyond what was already offered. Lawmakers and states have passed or begun implementing legislation calling for more inclusive instruction.The previous generation of courses focused on cultural awareness. What schools found, according to Maurice Hall \u2014 the dean of the College of New Jersey\u2019s arts and communications school and a social justice scholar \u2014 was that students still had socioeconomic, cultural and racial blind spots.Growing up with a majority point of view could mean thinking that the way a particular culture sees the world \u201cis in fact the right way,\u201d Hall said.Connecticut implemented a law in December requiring high schools to offer courses on Black and Latino studies. New Jersey, where learning standards already included some diversity education lessons, last month became the latest state to enact a law requiring school districts to incorporate instruction on diversity and inclusion.A handful of other states have pending legislation that would make similar changes, including Washington and Virginia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.The pandemic is partly credited with the response to Floyd\u2019s death while pinned by a white police officer, a confrontation that was caught on video and beamed into homes where people were isolating. The effect spilled over into schools, said Michael Conner, the superintendent in Middletown, Connecticut. Students held rallies and helped put race at the top of educators\u2019 consciousness.African American and other non-European history tends to focus on how those societies were marginalized, while Europeans get portrayed as culturally competent, Conner said, something he calls a \u201cdeficit\u201d context, as opposed to an \u201casset\u201d context.Like 12-year-old Ebele, he pointed to learning about the same handful of prominent African-American figures.\u201cWhen I look at my education, the only time I learned about Black history in school was during the month of February,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned about my culture at the dining room table with my mother and grandmother.\u201dDistricts adding diversity to their curricula now have to determine how to do it and what that looks like.In New Jersey, the education department is required to come up with sample activities and resources for districts. And some schools there and elsewhere are adding books to the curriculum or examining them in new ways.In Middletown, Dan Raucci, an English supervisor, pointed out how \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee has long been a 10th-grade staple. Students and teachers are discussing whether Atticus Finch, the white attorney who defends a Black man accused of raping a white woman, is a \u201chero of today, or of that time period?\u201dBut the district has added new books, like Jason Reynolds\u2019 \u201cThe Boy in the Black Suit,\u201d a novel that follows a Black teenager as he deals with grief.The changes actually came before the Connecticut law\u2019s 2020 implementation, but last year\u2019s events underscored the imperative to revise the curriculum.New Jersey\u2019s legislation calls for creating a welcoming environment \u201cregardless of race or ethnicity, sexual and gender identities, mental and physical disabilities, and religious beliefs.\u201d It also seeks to examine unconscious bias, or implicit prejudice.That raised concerns among some right-leaning groups that the government was forcing students to adopt beliefs. Among those testifying against the bill was the conservative Family Policy Alliance of New Jersey.\u201cStudents should learn to be respectful of others\u2019 beliefs and backgrounds based upon their unique experiences and cultures,\u201d said Shawn Hyland, advocacy director, said in a statement last year. \u201cHowever, \u2018diversity\u2019 trainings in public schools are the very opposite of respect.\u201dThat criticism suggests conservative states \u2014 unlike liberal New Jersey and other states passing laws on curriculum diversity \u2014 may balk at such curricula. Already in Iowa, lawmakers have passed a bill to ban school diversity training, and in Idaho, lawmakers voted to kill a higher education budget over diversity programs in universities.But in New Jersey, Ebele\u2019s mother, Rume Joy Azikiwe-Oyeyemi, 38, was surprised her daughter\u2019s efforts were met with such support. She said she had no idea that so much headway could be made in such a short time.\u201cAs her mom I am beyond proud,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/education/2021/04/a-letter-from-a-nj-6th-grader-made-black-history-a-national-issue-meet-the-student-who-wrote-it.html", "date": "2021-04-08161789760072412:00:00"}
