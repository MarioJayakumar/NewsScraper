{"title": "March Madness 2021: N.J. native coaching up UCLA during Cinderella run to Elite Eight | NCAA Tournament", "body": "Former St. Anthony's guard Darren Savino, far left, is coaching with UCLA in the Elite Eight. He won the New Jersey Tournament of Champions with St. Anthony's in 1989.Darren Savino has been in the  bubble in Indianapolis for two weeks now. On Saturday, he called his old high school coach, who was anxious to talk about Savino\u2019s UCLA team and their surprising run in the Big Dance.\u201cOh, it\u2019s everything, I\u2019ve known him since I\u2019m a little boy,\u201d Savino said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just he\u2019s my former high school coach. I grew up with his sons. I was in his house. We had little birthday parties when you\u2019re little kids and you put the little hats on your heads. So it\u2019s more love than it is he\u2019s just my high school coach.\u201dSavino, 49, is a Jersey City native who teamed with Bobby and Danny Hurley  and a mythical USA Today national championship during his senior season in 1989.Now he\u2019s the associate head coach under Mick Cronin as No. 11 UCLA is set to face No. 1 Michigan in the Elite Eight on Tuesday (9:57 p.m. ET, TBS). The Bruins, who began the tournament by knocking off Michigan State in the \u201cFirst Four,\u201d are the first team since VCU in 2011 to win a Sweet 16 game after coming out of the \u201cFirst Four.\u201d UCLA knocked off No. 2 Alabama, 87-78, in a thrilling overtime game Sunday night to claim its first Elite Eight appearance since 2008 when the Bruins reached the Final Four.UCLA is one of three Pac-12 teams to advance to the Elite Eight along with Oregon State, which faces Houston on Monday night, and USC, which knocked off Pac-12 rival Oregon Sunday and meets overall No. 1 seed Gonzaga in the early game on Tuesday.\u201cI\u2019m totally rooting for UCLA, totally,\u201d Hurley, the Naismith Hall of Fame coach, said Monday by phone. \u201cI\u2019m a Pac-12 guy this time of the year because of the association with Bobby [the head coach at Arizona State] and Darren. And the Big East is officially done.\u201dWhen the tournament began,  that had former players either competing or coaching: UConn is coached by Danny Hurley and featured former St. Anthony\u2019s guard R.J. Cole, Iona had former Friars guard Asante Gist and UCLA had Savino, who sees Hurley as a father figure.\u201cWhen my mom passed away, Coach Hurley and Chris Hurley were the first people at the wake when the funeral parlor opened up, so that\u2019s the kind of relationship we have,\u201d Savino said.For Bob Sr., Savino was almost another son.\u201cHe and Bobby are the same age, so they went to school together,\u201d Hurley Sr. said. \u201cThey both attended Our Lady of Mercy in Jersey City, both played Little League together, played grammar school basketball together and then for the four years that were in high school, Darren commuted back and forth with me. They were in the car together every day after practice because Darren lived in the same neighborhood so he would be dropped off before we got home. He was Bobby\u2019s best friend growing up and we\u2019re so proud of him.\u201cHe was really a nice young man. He was a baseball and basketball player in high school, and probably baseball was his better sport.\u201dAfter St. Anthony, Savino was a member of the Jersey City basketball team that advanced to the NCAA Division III Final Four in 1992. He graduated from Jersey City College with a degree in business administration, specializing in sports management. He began his coaching career as a junior varsity and assistant varsity coach at Marist High School in Bayonne.His college coaching career has included stops at numerous schools, including Rutgers, where he was an assistant under Fred Hill from 2006-10, St. John\u2019s and He\u2019s been with Cronin at Murray State, Cincinnati and now UCLA.The Bruins lost their last four games of the season -- after leading at the half in every game -- but have now beaten Michigan State, BYU, Abilene Christian and Alabama, While the Big Ten (9) and Big 12 (7) entered with a combined 16 teams, they only have Michigan (Big Ten) and Baylor (Big 12) remaining. The Pac-12 has three of its five original teams left. The league hasn\u2019t won a championship since Arizona in 1997.While much of the country may be surprised to see the Pac-12 doing so well in March, Savino isn\u2019t surprised.\u201cNo, no, no, we knew how good the teams were,\u201d Savino said. \u201cFor us, we lost four games at the end of the season that we were winning all four games. Two of the games we lost pretty much at the last second at USC and at Oregon State.\u201dSavino pointed out that Stanford, Arizona and Arizona State were all tough teams that weren\u2019t in the tournament.\u201cEverybody\u2019s starting to see that we have really good teams in our league,\u201d Savino said.The Bruins have been cooped on one hotel floor up in the bubble for two weeks now but they got out recently to visit the zoo and play Topgolf.\u201cThank God we\u2019re not advancing in the tournament because of our golfing skills,\u201d Savino joked.\u201cOther than that, it\u2019s like a frat house. The guys are just really enjoying hanging out with each other.\u201dSavino doesn\u2019t like to talk about himself, but ultimately he would like to become a head coach at his own program. It\u2019s possible that Cincinnati will soon part ways with head coach John Brannen, but may opt to target a former head coach like Archie Miller, John Beilein or Tim Miles.Still, both Cronin and Hurley Sr. believe Savino will one day be a great head coach.\u201cI know he wants to be and he would be,\u201d Hurley Sr. said. \u201cYou have to have empathy and you have to understand everybody\u2019s feelings on a team and Darren first of all would totally understand team because he\u2019s been a part of successful teams since he was a kid.\u201cAnd he\u2019s been in the business now for 25 years so you\u2019re not getting somebody who\u2019s just getting started. And he\u2019s also worked with Mick and Mick is an excellent coach. So he\u2019s had a lot of input and he\u2019s had great training. But hey, if the worst thing in the world is that Darren is an assistant coach at UCLA in Westwood, Calif., life\u2019s pretty good.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/setonhall/2021/03/march-madness-2021-nj-native-coaching-up-ucla-during-cinderella-run-to-elite-eight-ncaa-tournament.html", "date": "2021-03-29161703261445911:43:34"}
