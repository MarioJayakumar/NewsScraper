The policy is clearly stated on the brewery\u2019s website. Many restaurants and bars have adopted the same rule since outdoor dining returned in June (indoor in September).Why have they added this rule, you ask? Oh, no reason, really. Just the , which has seen hundreds of New Jersey eateries and watering holes . Even at 50% capacity, many businesses are still drowning in debt and doing whatever they can to get as many butts in seats as possible on a given day.Hence the give-and-take: Patrons get to dine out again, vaccinated or not, and all they need to do is hit the road after an hour and a half so a new group can shuffle in.But some people, like this ding-dong, just can\u2019t handle it. How dare this place they voluntarily visited ask them to make a small concession just so they can keep the doors open?And of course, the server \u2014 who has nothing to do with any of this \u2014 was forced to bear the brunt of this customer\u2019s idiocy. Luckily, local residents rallied around the employee and  to make up for the lost tip. How\u2019s that for poetic justice?I have so many questions for this jerk, most of which begin with \u201chow dare you?\u201d To admit you are well-aware your miserly tipping is unjustly hurting the server? To have the nerve to not just leave no tip, but self-righteously spell out \u201czero\u201d on the tip line? To think that you were actually making a statement, proving a point or changing anything other than taking 17 bucks you should have been tipping right out of a server\u2019s pocket? I can\u2019t write the words to properly convey how furious this makes me without getting fired.To be clear, you shouldn\u2019t be lingering at a table even when there isn\u2019t a deadly virus spreading across the world, it\u2019s simple . You definitely shouldn\u2019t be doing it now. If you aren\u2019t okay finishing a meal within 90 minutes, just stay home and order takeout. Sitting for hours at a bar to watch sports is great in normal times, but we are not in normal times right now.I\u2019ve talked to dozens of bar and restaurant owners and workers over the past year, and many of them tell me the hardest part of operating a dining establishment during COVID is  on top of their restaurant responsibilities. They want things to go back to normal just as bad as you do, trust me. Following simple rules, that are in place for your safety just as much as for theirs, is the least you can do.If you have been vaccinated and finally feel safe dining out again, that\u2019s terrific. But just because things are getting better doesn\u2019t mean the pandemic is over. It isn\u2019t. Restaurants aren\u2019t 100% back to normal yet, and it could be a very long time before they are. Until they are, let\u2019s do everything we can to keep them in business.Can\u2019t deal with a 90-minute table limit? Fine. Take all the time you want to eat.
