{"title": "Why Devils\u2019 Tom Fitzgerald didn\u2019t trade Ryan Murray ahead of NHL deadline | 4 takeaways", "body": "New Jersey Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald explains why the team didn't move defenseman Ryan Murray ahead of the NHL trade deadline.The  of potential  trade candidates ahead of Monday\u2019s  was pretty clear. The handful of pending unrestricted free agents were all on the table to move.General manager  did ship out several, including  and .But as the 3 p.m. deadline came and went on Monday, one notable name remained on the roster: defenseman Ryan Murray.Fitzgerald flipped a fifth-round pick to bring Murray to New Jersey during the offseason. Prior to the deadline, he had conversations with teams about the former No. 2 overall pick before ultimately standing pat.\u201cI just didn\u2019t feel that the offers were something of value to us as an organization, to take another veteran out of this lineup,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe still want to be competitive. We will be competitive. We want to win every game and play hard and we want to make sure we\u2019re not digressing in our development curve with our young kids. Ryan still helps us stay competitive and I just wasn\u2019t giving players away.\u201dThe departure of Kulikov in a trade to the Edmonton Oilers and the  on waivers to the Dallas Stars will open up a pair of spots on the blue line for other players in the final 16 games of the season. But along with keeping P.K. Subban, Fitzgerald saw the merit of having another veteran in Murray stick around.Fitzgerald was asked about to potential of signing Murray to a new contract for next season, but the Devils aren\u2019t at that point yet.\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you we\u2019re going to go out and sign him tomorrow,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that, and I\u2019ve been on record to say and honest and transparent to all the players, that I don\u2019t really talk to players about contracts right now. There\u2019s a time and place for that. We own these kids\u2019 rights right through the summer, so I\u2019ll have plenty of time to evaluate where we go next with individuals.\u201dHere are some other notable things from Fitzgerald about the trade deadline:Since taking over as interim GM last season, Fitzgerald has made it clear  and Jack Hughes are part of the foundation for the team going forward.He had clear visions for other players joining that group, but he didn\u2019t always name them. After the way Ty Smith has played as a rookie, Fitzgerald views the defenseman in that same light.\u201cHis game has really been above and beyond what I imagined would happen this year,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI really thought he\u2019d spend the bulk of the time with Binghamton, come on up, get some experience. But the confidence, the poise. It\u2019s just on display pretty much every single night and that, as a true 20 year old rookie, has been very impressive.\u201dTeams are allowed to retain up to 50% of a cap hit on three players at any given point, and the Devils did just that for Palmieri and Zajac after they were traded to the Islanders last week.A few other teams around the league even served as third-party brokers at the deadline, taking on part of a cap hit to help the money work in a trade for two other teams while getting a draft pick for their troubles.The Devils had the cap space to potentially be that broker for another deal, but Fitzgerald wanted to keep that option open ahead of the Seattle expansion draft this summer.\u201cFor teams like us, we\u2019re Seattle\u2019s competition. We\u2019d like to use our cap space,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI didn\u2019t use my third retainer slot today, and that\u2019s an asset moving forward. And that was on purpose. I just felt like that may come in handy. I want that in the back pocket if I need it to improve this team in the offseason.\u201dMonday was just the second for Fitzgerald as the team\u2019s general manager and his first in the role full time. But he\u2019s well aware the Devils are looking at missing the playoffs for the eighth time in nine years.Fitzgerald has liked the progress he\u2019s seen from the young roster this season, and his objective is to keep pushing that trajectory forward.\u201cI know saying let\u2019s be patient is an overstatement and something the organization has been saying for some time now,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cBut I would look at the pauses and look at when these kids start really arriving. Where\u2019s Jack gonna be in two years from now? How\u2019s his game going to look? Where\u2019s Nico healthy? Where\u2019s ( going to be in two years? And the young guys coming.\u201cI just think there\u2019s so much excitement for our fan base to look at, and again, being patient is an overstatement, but it\u2019s my job to continue to push the organization in the right direction around these kids and not rush the process where we\u2019re at \u2026 We\u2019ll know exactly what we need to stay competitive. But at the end of day, when these kids pop, that\u2019s when we have hope we\u2019ll be competing day in, day out for the division.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/why-devils-tom-fitzgerald-didnt-trade-ryan-murray-ahead-of-nhl-deadline.html", "date": "2021-04-13161831905393309:04:13"}
