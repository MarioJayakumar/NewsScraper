{"title": "N.J. is seeking State Police recruits, but applications are \u2018historically low,\u2019 officials say", "body": "Members of the 161st New Jersey State Police Class parade during the graduation ceremony at the Prudential Center in Newark on Wednesday, March 17, 2021.   New Jersey is getting fewer applicants to apply to become police officers in the wake of nationwide protests and a global pandemic, officials said, even as leaders and activists agree departments need to diversify.The problem is especially acute for the state\u2019s largest agency.In some years the State Police would field between 15,000 and 20,000 applicants, according to Col. Patrick Callahan, the department\u2019s acting superintendent. But they only had a \u201chistorically low\u201d 2,023 qualified applicants as of Thursday, about a week before deadline, Callahan said.Leaders have   more to apply.\u201cI think the young men and women, when they look around the country and they see things that are going on and question it, I think it\u2019s time for those to step up and be a part of igniting change,\u201d Callahan .Current events have created strong headwinds.Hundreds of officers statewide were sickened by the , and several died, while police face increasing scrutiny since thousands of residents took to the streets in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. The added stress has led officers to .Police leaders said those and other factors have left several local departments scrambling to find good candidates.\u201cThe atmosphere with police work right now is people just don\u2019t want to apply,\u201d said Robert Fox, president of the New Jersey State Fraternal Order of Police. Many are thinking, \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll try later when things improve,\u201d he said.For example, in the last year or so in Paterson, around one hundred people have told recruiters they\u2019re not quite ready to apply, said Police Director Jerry Speziale. But they asked to stay on the list, he said.\u201cSome are outstanding candidates,\u201d Speziale said. \u201cPeople used to fight for this job.\u201dEverything from \u201canti-police sentiment\u201d to  have led fewer people to sign up statewide, said Pat Colligan, president of the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association.\u201cThere will always be applicants, but what\u2019s the quality of the applicant?\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality has really diminished in the last few years.\u201dThe problems aren\u2019t new.Even before the coronavirus, departments nationwide reported recruitment troubles, according to a 2018 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum.Out of hundreds of agencies, more than 60% said the number of candidates applying for full-time positions had decreased in recent years. Many changed internal policies to widen the net, including making it easier for people who had used drugs to apply and relaxing tattoo restrictions, according to the survey.Not everyone is feeling the same strain.In Camden County, a spokesman said Voorhees\u2019 department hasn\u2019t seen a dip in interest.Further east in Ocean County, Barnegat is actually seeing applications rise. While around 200 people might have signed up for an application test a decade ago, that number was closer to 400 last year, according to Barnegat Police Chief Keith Germain.He partially credited aggressive marketing \u2014 Germain cited buying $200 Facebook ads that can reach large audiences \u2014 but he thought more applications were mainly the result of increasing salaries.Barnegat officers can now make $130,000 within five years, Germain said, and the current crop of recruits was their \u201cmost diverse applicant pool\u201d ever.\u201cTo get people to commit to doing this, before anything else, we\u2019re going to have to pay them well,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in this climate.\u201dLawmakers have recently passed bills pushing departments to recruit more minorities, and agencies are still finding ways to hire. A spokesman for New Jersey\u2019s , which oversees academies for local departments, said classes remained full.The State Police\u2019s  deadline is midnight on April 23, for a class that will begin training next winter.Callahan said he had hoped the pandemic would have drawn people to law enforcement, like the 9/11 attacks did, but morale was now low for even current officers.Of the State Police\u2019s applicants, 1,734 are men and 268 are women, Callahan said Thursday. (A few didn\u2019t select a gender.) About 44% are white, 20% are Hispanic, 18% are Black and 5% are Asian, he added.Officials will select a few hundred people out of the applications to train at the academy. Fewer than  recently graduated from the newest class, and another group will begin training in August.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/news/2021/04/nj-is-seeking-state-police-recruits-but-applications-are-historically-low-officials-say.html", "date": "2021-04-17161868960072816:00:00"}
