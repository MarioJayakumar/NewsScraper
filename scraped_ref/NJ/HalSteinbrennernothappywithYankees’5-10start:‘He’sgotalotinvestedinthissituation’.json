{"title": "Hal Steinbrenner not happy with Yankees\u2019 5-10 start: \u2018He\u2019s got a lot invested in this situation\u2019", "body": "Yankees managing partner Hal Steinbrenner is disappointed that his ballclub, a World Series favorite heading into the season, is off to a 5-10 start. managing partner hasn\u2019t commented publicly on his ballclub having the worst record in the American League. General manager has been in contact with his boss, and understandably, ownership is taking this 5-10 start lightly.\u201cHe\u2019s disappointed, clearly,\u201d Cashman said . \u201cHal obviously has got a lot invested in this situation, but he\u2019s also a fan just like we all are. Our expectation is to provide great Yankee baseball for those who come to the games or those who are watching the games, and we haven\u2019t done that here in the beginning of April.\u201dThe Yankees\u2019 start in their worst since they were 5-10 in 1997, and they\u2019re struggling while having baseball second-highest payroll.\u201cClearly, we\u2019ve got to self-correct out here over the course of time,\u201d Cashman added. \u201cBut we understand why there\u2019s some doubts currently and question marks and a lot of head scratching on how the roster currently has performed thus far. But it\u2019s 15 games. It was 15 games I like to forget. The only way I\u2019m going to forget them is doing something about it in the next 15 and seeing how those results look.\u201dSteinbrenner and Cashman have been big supporters of manager Aaron Boone\u2019s body of work over his first three seasons, andduring these struggles.\u201cOur record is reflective of our organization,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cObviously, Aaron\u2019s a piece of that, as am I. But otherwise he\u2019s doing everything he needs to do. \u2026 Obviously he spoke to the team after that tough loss (on Friday night). He obviously engaged the group in a strong way. So he\u2019s doing everything he needs to do, and most importantly supporting these guys because we trust our players and we trust their abilities and we trust over the course of time that will, as it normally does, correct itself with a lot more games on the belt. So I think Aaron Boone is doing everything he can do within his power currently.\u201dCashman, Steinbrenner and the entire organization is upset that. Last year, the offense was first in the league in runs, OPS and on-base percentage, second in homers and sixth in average. This year, it\u2019s 14th among 15 AL teams in average (.215) and runs per game (3.7); 13th in OPS (.642) 11th in on-base percentage (.296) and tied for ninth in home runs (16).\u201cRight now we would be a team that an opponent would want to play because obviously we\u2019re not firing on all cylinders,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cOur strengths obviously are not showing themselves right now. So if you had a chance to catch us right now, you\u2019re catching us at the right time through (Sunday\u2019s) game. We look forward to that changing.\u201dDJ LeMahieu\u2019s, last season\u2019s MLB batting champ, is the only Yankees\u2019 regular hitting above .255 and five of the nine starters are below .200.\u201cTypically it\u2019s a very tough lineup to navigate,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cTypically it\u2019s a lineup that controls the strike zone and punishes strikes and spits on balls and wears you out and usually gets a starter out early and gets into the \u2018pen and continues that damage. That passing of the baton, right now that\u2019s not happening. But part of this scenario is how you handle it while you\u2019re going through it.\u201cOur message to our players and therefore our fans is we are going to fight our way out of that start, and hopefully by the end of the month you\u2019ll see a more reflective record that gets us back online and gets people\u2019s confidence back to where it should be.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/hal-steinbrenner-not-happy-with-yankees-5-10-start-hes-got-a-lot-invested-in-this-situation.html", "date": "2021-04-19161886738306817:23:03"}
