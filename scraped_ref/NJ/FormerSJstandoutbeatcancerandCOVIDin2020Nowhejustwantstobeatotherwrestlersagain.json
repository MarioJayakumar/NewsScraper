Now he just wants to beat other wrestlers again", "body": "Washington Township wrestling practice, April 9, 2021Mike LaRosa has attacked beating cancer and COVID the way he did wrestling during a four-year career that saw him go from a junior varsity wrestler as a freshman to a state qualifier as a senior.A 2020 Washington Township High School graduate, LaRosa was an 170-pound district champion and state qualifier as a senior last year. He committed to Division 3 Muhlenberg to continue a career that was really just beginning.But then in the middle of a pandemic, LaRosa found a lump on his neck. The result of a biopsy was Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma and his college and athletic plans were suddenly put on hold.He spent over three months undergoing chemotherapy treatments and in the middle of it all he tested positive for COVID-19 in November. Once he was out of quarantine, he went right back to the treatments.\u201cI had a fever, just thought it was side effects from the treatment, some weeks you feel worse than you usually do, I thought I was just having a bad week, I was really tired,\u201d said LaRosa. \u201cThen they took a blood culture and it was negative, and they said it might be COVID and that\u2019s what it was.\u201dMike LaRosa, who recently beat cancer, helps out with Washington Township wrestling practice at Washington Township High School, Friday, April 9, 2021. LaRosa\u2019s last CAT scan came back all clear on Feb. 10 and his doctors told him they expected he would make a full recovery. It was time to get back into wrestling shape and because of the pandemic the NJSIAA wrestling season \u2013 which usually runs from December to early March \u2013 was just getting set to begin on March 1.Washington Township coach Eric Ring asked LaRosa to assist with practices and the recent graduate has been helping to develop the current Minutemen this season. Township will take part in the South Region Tournament this weekend.\u201cIt was kind of on two fronts, we wanted Michael here for the kids, they all looked up to him as a big-time leader and he was a kid who came into the program with not a ton of experience ,but he worked himself into a successful wrestler,\u201d said Ring. \u201cWith the cancer and treatment delaying college, we thought it would be good for him as well, to push himself again.\u201cIt was tough to hear when we found out last summer, I can only imagine how tough it was on him. It worked out we were able to get him in here, and he\u2019s been a huge asset. Kids who go through similar stuff, he shows what can happen. Cancer is one of the scariest things in the world, but it can be beat. Mike is living proof of that.\u201dLaRosa admitted it\u2019s been a little strange going from teammate to coach with some wrestlers, but the transition has been smooth and he\u2019s been continuing to build up his strength and activity.\u201cI\u2019ve been working out my own, wrestling, lifting, running, feeling better and better every day,\u201d said LaRosa. \u201cCoach Eric asked me to help once we knew everything better. It\u2019s been different coaching, telling guys what to do but it\u2019s been fun. I\u2019m just getting back into things one step at a time. One hundred percent, it\u2019s helped with my physical and mental health.\u201dWashington Township assistant coach John Rinick is LaRosa\u2019s neighbor and LaRosa\u2019s brother Anthony is his best friend, so he saw Mike frequently from the start of his recovery.\u201cAt first it was really sad to see what he had to go through, but he never complained once,\u201d said Rinick. \u201cHe did what the doctors told him to do and never said why me? He was still the same person, always happy. It\u2019s the way he was in wrestling, never complained, whatever we asked, would tell his teammates not to complain about running sprints.\u201cThat\u2019s the way he attacked cancer. He worked his tail off to go from JV to the state tournament when most people would say he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. He defied the odds in wrestling and made the best of this situation.\u201dMike LaRosa of Washington Township walks off the mat following an overtime win against Sammy Drogo of Buena in a 170-pound quarterfinal bout of the NJSIAA Region 8 wrestling tournament at Egg Harbor Township High School, Friday, Feb. 28, 2020. Ring and Rinick both feel this year off will be a benefit to LaRosa going forward as he prepares to enroll in Muhlenberg in September and start his college wrestlng career.\u201cI think you get better wrestling from coaching because you learn more,\u201d said Ring. \u201cSelfishly it\u2019s been good to have him this year. I can\u2019t say anything about this has been good, but the timing for him was not horrible.\u201cMy goal for him hasn\u2019t changed. This is a hiccup in the road. He\u2019s the kid that powers through everything. He\u2019s the kind of kid that will get better every time he practices, and I don\u2019t see that being any different. My brother (Mark, a junior coach) and I said if we can get him in the right college program, he\u2019ll keep getting better and better, and I think he\u2019ll hit the ground running next year.\u201dWhile LaRosa originally worried about the cancer returning, he said he doesn\u2019t anymore. And he feels what he has gone through over the last nine months has made him more motivated to excel in college.\u201cActually I do think I\u2019ll be better,\u201d said LaRosa. \u201cIt gave me a whole new mindset on things. I wasn\u2019t doing anything for six months, I want to do everything now, and I want to get better as a wrestler.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/former-sj-standout-beat-cancer-and-covid-in-2020-now-he-just-wants-to-beat-other-wrestlers-again.html", "date": "2021-04-13161835482687719:00:26"}
