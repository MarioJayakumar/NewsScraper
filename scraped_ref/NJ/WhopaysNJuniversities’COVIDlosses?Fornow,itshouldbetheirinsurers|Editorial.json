{"title": "Who pays N.J. universities\u2019 COVID losses? For now, it should be their insurers | Editorial", "body": "Factory Mutual Insurance Co. isn\u2019t as familiar to consumers as many insurance companies. It\u2019s definitely not the one whose TV ads portray seemingly unbelievable \u2014 but historically true \u2014 accidents, before a character actor announces that handling the case is a snap, because \u201cWe know a thing or two because we\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\u201dWell, Factory Mutual and its insurance brethren haven\u2019t seen this before: court clashes with purchasers of its coverage who think the insurer blew off loss claims stemming from COVID-19.Joining hordes of small businesses, Rowan University has sued its property/casualty vendor, Factory Mutual of Rhodes Island, for allegedly refusing to pay out on a 2019-2020 policy. The university insists that its policy provides coverage against extra expenses and business losses because of \u201cinterruption by communicable disease.\u201dUnless there is a rapid settlement, the two parties will duke it out in Superior Court in Gloucester County.You know a lot of insurance proceeds are at stake when these companies essentially take the position that hurricanes are easy and coronaviruses are hard.Rowan claims that it\u2019s owed unspecified millions of dollars in coronavirus losses. The university operates in 24 locations, with almost 20,000 students and more than 4,700 employees. Overall, it\u2019s big enough that its court case can provide wider guidance for educational institutions. The main principle is similar to those small-business lawsuits filed by restaurants and beauty shops: The business \u2014 or college \u2014 maintains it was forced to shut down for a time to comply with an emergency order from the governor. Their insurance company maintains that it doesn\u2019t have to pay because \u2014 well, we don\u2019t exactly know why \u2014 except that some supposed exemption in the policy makes the claim ineligible.Asked by NJ Advance Media about the Rowan case, Factory Mutual issued a nondescript statement about how \u201cit is unfortunate when legal matters arise because we strongly believe our insurance policies are clear on the coverage provided.\u201dWe urge Rowan to stick to its guns, since its interpretation of its policy is that the COVID-19 losses are covered. In the absence of policy language that expressly prevents such payouts, unexpected demands should be the insurers\u2019 burden to bear \u2014 for 2020.That said, all sorts of scenarios could bounce back onto the schools or the taxpayers.\u2014 Could insurers file a counterclaim against Gov. Phil Murphy or the state health department, insisting that the shutdowns and limited capacity rules were unnecessary?\u2014 Will educational facilities face lawsuits from students or employees who contend they contracted COVID-19 because in-person classes restarted too soon, or because the place was lax in enforcing or providing proper protocols?\u2014 To what extent will federal aid and Paycheck Protection dollars cover university and school district financial losses? You can\u2019t expect even the most reviled insurer to pony up for the same expenses that the government reimbursed.Also, the Legislature must get up to speed in setting reasonable parameters to indemnifying colleges, school districts and private schools. Not all of the controversial pandemic decisions that educational providers have made were dictates from aboveMost colleges, schools, including Rowan, refused to grant meaningful tuition refunds to students who argue they were cheated by having to take virtual classes. Some students are suing their schools over this.You can bet that insurers have learned \u201ca thing or two\u201d in the past year, and that their renewal policies will specifically exclude pandemic losses, or demand extra premium dollars if a client wants them covered.At this point, Rowan and Stockton universities \u2014 unlike Rutgers \u2014 have not required that their students be vaccinated in order to attend on-campus classes this fall. What if an unvaccinated-by-choice student spreads COVID-19 to others who can\u2019t get the shot for health reasons? It sounds like lawsuit city, all over again.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/who-pays-nj-universities-covid-losses-for-now-it-should-be-their-insurers-editorial.html", "date": "2021-04-15161848674042207:39:00"}
