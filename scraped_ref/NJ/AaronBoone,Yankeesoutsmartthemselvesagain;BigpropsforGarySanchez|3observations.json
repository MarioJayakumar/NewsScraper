{"title": "Aaron Boone, Yankees outsmart themselves again; Big props for Gary Sanchez | 3 observations", "body": "Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez (right) had a great night behind the plate during Friday night's loss and Giancarlo Stanton (bottom left) continued to produce, but the decision to start Nick Nelson (top left) didn't work out.It\u2019s the middle of April, and already it seems like the sky is falling on the . They\u2019re 5-8 after 13 games, and their latest loss was atrocious. They\u2019re still having all kinds of trouble with the Tampa Rays, and at Yankee Stadium was a beating.\u201cI think you have to zoom out and look at it from a little bit further away sometimes and realize we\u2019re so early into the season,\u201d Yankees left fielder Clint Frazier said after going 0-for-3 with three strikeouts. \u201cAnd obviously that excuse can only go so far. We can only say that so long before we have to have results.\u201dFrazier\u2019s right. A 5-8 record isn\u2019t the same as being three-under .500 in May or June or July, but bad starts can lead to bad seasons. The Yankees remember being 5-8 in 2019, then winning 103 games, but that was then and this is now.\u201cWe can\u2019t be rolling out there taking hits like that,\u201d designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton said. \u201cThat\u2019s not our game. That\u2019s not how we should come out and play.\u201dHere are three takeaways from one of the Yankees\u2019 most appalling losses in years:Kudos to manager Aaron Boone for calling a team meeting immediately after Friday night\u2019s loss, which included just three Yankees hits and three errors. It was refreshing hearing Frazier and Stanton mention how angry Boone was. Fans and media never see the side of Boone that will get on his players, so it\u2019s good knowing it does happen.But what Boone did before the game triggered this ugly loss. Once again, the Yankees tried to outsmart everyone, and it backfired in a big way using  as the opener ahead of a long relief outing by Michael King.Just back from the alternate site on Friday,  during his first Yankees stint this season. In game three, he pitched six scoreless innings of one-hit relief. But the Yanks opted to go with Nelson, who went into first Major League start on the heels of a terrible outing \u2014 four runs over 1 2/3 innings a week earlier at Tampa Bay.Even before Nelson couldn\u2019t find the strike zone allowing two runs in a 30-pitch first, this decision screamed dumb. It was reminiscent of Game 2 of the 2020 ALDS when as the opener before going to usual starter J.A. Happ in the second inning. The Rays won the game to even the best-of-five series and went on to win in five.On Friday night, the Rays were on their way to beating the Yanks for the 14th time in 19 games since 2020 (counting playoffs) by the time Nelson\u2019s one-inning outing was over.King followed Nelson and worked three shutout innings to keep the Yanks down just two runs. King wasn\u2019t as sharp as he was in his first outing, but three scoreless is three scoreless.Even Michael Kay addressed this issue while calling the game on YES.\u201cWhy not start King?\u201d Kay said. \u201cWhat was the advantage of starting Nelson? They\u2019re both right-handed, so you\u2019re not going to spin around a lineup. I\u2019m sure that they had lanes that they felt both pitchers would be strong in, but King is a starter and most of Nelson\u2019s games in the minors (were starts). So it\u2019s not as if you really needed to employ an opener there.\u201dAll of that makes sense.Boone\u2019s decision, which surely has the analytics staff\u2019s fingerprints all over it, did not make sense.Oh, and the Yanks\u2019 decision to immediately farm out King after the game is ridiculous, too. What does he have to do to keep a roster spot? So far this season, he\u2019s pitched nine shutout innings over two relief apperances, and he\u2019s been farmed out twice.Before Friday night\u2019s game turned into a blowout, Yankees catcher  kept his team down just two runs four times.I\u2019ve been very hard on Sanchez for a lot of shoddy receiving the last few seasons, but his blocking has drastically improved this year and this part of his game never was better on Friday.With two Tampa Bay runs in, a runner on third and Joey Wendle hitting in the first inning, Nelson threw a curveball that bounced in front of the plate. Sanchez has had all kinds of problems preventing wild pitches on these challenges in past seasons, but this time he positioned himself perfectly, blocked the ball off his chest protector and kept it in front of him. This saved a run.Two batters later, the Rays still had a runner on third with one down when Nelson threw a 2-0 fastball to Manuel Margot. Sanchez set up low and inside, but Nelson\u2019s 96-mph heater was two feet outside and head high. This time, Sanchez quickly jumped out from his on-one-knee stance, stabbed at the ball and got it. Another run was saved.After Margot walked, Mike Brosseau hit with runners on the corners. Nelson\u2019s 1-0 offering was a curveball in the dirt that was off the plate. Sanchez made it look easy, and he was textbook sliding his body to his right and grabbing the pitch on a short hop. Amazingly, Sanchez saved Nelson from another wild pitch that would have brought in a third run.With the Yanks still trailing 2-0, Sanchez made it 4-for-4 in the third inning with King pitching to Brosseau, two down, and runners on second and third. Sanchez set up low and inside for a 1-2 pitch, but King\u2019s changeup was in the dirt and outside. Again Sanchez showed catlike quickness that never seemed to exist in past seasons, and he backhanded the ball to save a run. Brosseau struck out two pitches later to end the inning.Sanchez had a bad night at the plate \u2013 he was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts \u2013 but his most important job is his catching, so this was a great night for him. His defense still isn\u2019t close to perfect \u2014 he has three errors already \u2014 but his blocking on Friday night was proof that he\u2019s improving. Here\u2019s more: He\u2019s caught 10 games and has no passed balls after leading the league in this category three times in four years from 2017-20.The Yankees have been saying for two years that Stanton again will be one of baseball\u2019s most productive sluggers once he gets healthy and stay healthy.Maybe they\u2019re right and the many, many skeptics are wrong.Stanton is healthy and he\u2019s produced more than anyone in the Yankees\u2019 lineup thus far with 11 RBI in 11 games. Sure, he\u2019s hitting just .182 with 13 strikeouts in 44 at-bats, and he\u2019s not happy about that, but a ribbie per game for a couple weeks isn\u2019t a bad way to start a season.Stanton was the Yankees\u2019 offense on Friday night. His seventh-inning liner to right reached the seats in a hurry for a two-run homer that cut into an 8-0 Rays lead. He finished the night 1-for-4 with two strikeouts. The average needs to come up and Stanton needs to cut down on the strikeouts, but the steady run production sparks more optimism that he\u2019ll post numbers similar to 2018 when he hit 38 homers and knocked in 100 runs in his first season as a Yankee.\u201cI\u2019m very inconsistent,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cI feel like my balance is off a little bit. It\u2019s improving, so I\u2019ve just got to put together some good games, some good at-bats back-to-back and go from there.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/aaron-boone-yankees-outsmart-themselves-again-big-props-for-gary-sanchez-3-observations.html", "date": "2021-04-17161866499136609:09:51"}
