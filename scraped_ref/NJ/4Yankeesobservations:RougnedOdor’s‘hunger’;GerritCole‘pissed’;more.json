In the next at-bat,  crushed a two-run shot and the Yankees took the lead for good.\u201cHe\u2019s had some real competitive at-bats, some hard-hit balls both days,\u201d manager  said. \u201cThere\u2019s an energy he brings to the field everyday. I feel like there\u2019s a hunger that he\u2019s playing the game with. I just like what he brings to the field everyday.\u201dBoone added, \u201cI think he could be a real contributor for us.\u201dThe Yankees traded for Odor last week, sending two prospects to Texas, which is eating the $27 million Odor is owed. Though Odor has struggled mightily the last four seasons, posting just a .697 OPS with a ton of strikeouts, the Yankees saw some things in him \u2014 aside from potential defensive versatility at second base and third base \u2014 that they liked.It surely wasn\u2019t lost on the Yankees that Odor can absolutely mash when he makes contact. Here\u2019s his max exit velocity percentile rankings the last three years: 76th (2020), 89th (2019) and 88th (2018). And here are his barrel rate percentiles: 79th (2020), 92nd (2019) and 51st (2018).It appears Odor will stay in the lineup for a while, especially as the Yankees figure out what to do with struggling (.111 BA, eight games).\u201cI liked how he moved in the field and turned a nice double play. He\u2019s gonna play and get opportunities. It\u2019s a day-to-day thing,\u201d Boone said.Here are three more observations: And the Yankees wouldn\u2019t hate if it happened more often. Cole retired the final 15 batters he faced Monday night. He struggled a bit with his command early, giving up two first-inning hits and then a hit and a walk to start the second. What changes when Cole locks in? \u201cI think he gets a little pissed if stuff\u2019s not going the way he wants it to early, which is a good thing,\u201d Higashioka said. \u201cHe\u2019s never satisfied with anything less than putting up zeroes every time.\u201dThe pitch has been absolutely disgusting, and it was on display again Monday night when he got Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to strike out swinging on a 91.4 mph edition. According to researcher Katie Sharp, Chapman has thrown the pitch 13 times in a game. Of the eight times hitters have swung at it, they\u2019ve missed it every time.With the Yankees ahead, 2-1, Boone put Brett Gardner in left field in place of Frazier. It was an interesting move, although not unexpected. Gardner has long been considered the better defender between the two, but Frazier was a finalist for a Gold Glove last year, albeit in right field. \u201cJust getting Gardy on the field,\u201d Boone said.
