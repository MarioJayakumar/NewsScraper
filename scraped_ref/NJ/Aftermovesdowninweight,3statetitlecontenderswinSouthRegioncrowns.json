{"title": "After moves down in weight, 3 state title contenders win South Region crowns", "body": "NJSIAA South Region Wrestling Championships, April 17, 2021A week ago, Clearview\u2019s Ty Whalen, Southern\u2019s Eddie Hummel and Woodstown\u2019s Hunter Gandy looked like state-title contenders at 138, 145 and 152 pounds, respectively.A week from now, they will be championship contenders at 132, 138 and 145 after each moved down from the weight classes they competed at all season.The moves paid dividends on Saturday as all three won NJSIAA/Rothman Orthopaedics South Region titles.Gandy\u2019s was the most significant as he won his third region title - putting him in rarified air. In comparison, Woodstown has three other region champs in its history.Gandy defeated Toms River East\u2019s Michael Conklin, 3-2, in the 145-pound final. The Wolverine senior notched a first-period takedown and fought off two takedown attempts in the final minute by Conklin, who was also trying to win his third crown.\u201cI literally was thinking about the practice room with Ty and my club practice partners and we get in those positions all the time,\u201d said Gandy.\u201cI just wanted to stay in good positions, we work on stance motions with John VanBrill. I just kept moving my feet. The fastest person can\u2019t be beat.\u201dWoodstown's Hunter Gandy (top) wrestles Toms River East's Michael Conklin during the 145-pound championship match of the NJSIAA South Region Wrestling Tournament at Cherry Hill East High School, Saturday, April 17, 2021.Gandy said it was a hard decision to go down to 145 and ultimately he decided it would help him stay disciplined and stay hungry - perhaps literally.Now Gandy heads to Phillipsburg to try to get himself on the state podium for the first time.\u201cI\u2019m pumped, I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m ready to put it all on the line,\u201d said Gandy. \u201cIt\u2019s something I want to do, but at the end of the day a state title is something minute in my whole life, so I just want to have fun.\u201dHummel said his decision was easy as he was wrestling up for team reasons this year. He always planned to go down to 138 where he could meet two-time state champion Joey Olivieri - who Hummel beat in an offseason tournament in February.\u201cI weighed in at 138 for almost every match,\u201d said Hummel. \u201cI was walking around 146 this summer, so I was never going to be big enough for 145.\u201dSouthern's Eddie Hummel (top) wrestles Camden Catholic's Chase Casey during the 138-pound championship match of the NJSIAA South Region Wrestling Tournament at Cherry Hill East High School, Saturday, April 17, 2021.Hummel is a two-time state place winner, but he captured his first region crown when he pinned Camden Catholic\u2019s Chase Casey - his fourth pin of the day.\u201cIn reality regions is to qualify for states,\u201d said Hummel. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to win one. I wish I won more than one, but in the end you want to move on. I\u2019m wrestling really good right now, so I\u2019m confident of winning a state title.\u201dLike Hummel, Whalen never wrestled six minutes Saturday. He finished with a pin and three 15-0 technical falls.In the final, Whalen led Southern\u2019s Matt Brielmeier, 2-0, at the end of the first period before turning it on.\u201cI just try to stay relaxed, I\u2019ve been in a lot of matches where it\u2019s 0-0, 2-0 and I just tried to stay relaxed and wrestle,\u201d said Whalen, a junior who won his second region crown.Clearview's Ty Whalen celebrates his win against Southern's Matt Brielmeier during the 132-pound championship match of the NJSIAA South Region Wrestling Tournament at Cherry Hill East High School, Saturday, April 17, 2021.As for the move to 132, Whalen said his weight just started coming off easier than he thought.\u201cI was a little chubby from the summer and I just thought it would be best to come down,\u201d said Whalen. \u201cIt\u2019s just what\u2019s best for me.\u201dNext week the three will chase state titles in the same rare one-session format they were successful in at regions. It\u2019s not impossible they could go back-to-back-to-back again.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve been in this situation a couple times where you\u2019re wrestling a lot in one day,\u201d said Whalen. \u201cIt\u2019s different and I\u2019m definitely trying to enjoy it. No other year will ever be like this.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/after-moves-down-in-weight-3-state-title-contenders-win-south-region-crowns.html", "date": "2021-04-17161871268556322:24:45"}
