Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin picked up his second consecutive shutout against the Devils, stopping all 16 shots the Devils sent his way.Panarin\u2019s first goal capped off a 3-0 first period for the Rangers where the Devils were badly outplayed on both ends of the ice, and they didn\u2019t have much of an answer over the final 40 minutes. The Rangers finished with a 33-16 shot advantage.The Devils played the game without their top two scorers in Pavel Zacha and Jesper Bratt, who are both considered day-to-day with injuries.

Panarin hit the brakes to create space between himself and Devils defenseman Damon Severson before crushing as shot past Blackwood from the left circle off a pass from Ryan Strome.Panarin pushed the lead to 4-0 when he buried another Strome feed, this time while crashing the left post at 12:51 of the second period.The Rangers appeared to push the lead to 5-0 in the third period when Vitali Kravtsov netted what would have been his first career goal. But the Devils challenged for offside and successfully overturned the goal.The Devils and Rangers will play one more time at Madison Square Garden at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday before the series shifts back to Prudential Center in Newark at 3 p.m. on Sunday.
