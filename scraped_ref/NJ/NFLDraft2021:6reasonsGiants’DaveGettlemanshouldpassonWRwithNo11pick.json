Yes, I\u2019m serious. That even applies if one (or both) of Alabama\u2019s  or . I\u2019m well aware of how accomplished those players are. I\u2019ve seen their collegiate stats. I play fantasy football too.But none of that is changing my mind, and here\u2019s why.Come on. This is we\u2019re talking about here. This isn\u2019t a new-school, analytically-inclined general manager that wants to win by throwing the ball 50 times per game and having an array of pass catching weapons like the Kansas City Chiefs. Would anyone be shocked if the Giants took Northwestern\u2019s Rashawn Slater? Should any Giants fans be upset if that\u2019s how it goes down? I\u2019d vote \u201cno\u201d for either of those hypothetical questions.This is a make-or-break year for Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. The Giants know it. The entire NFL knows it. And if the roster was lacking in weapons around Jones, the Giants would be wise to either take a wide receiver at No. 11 or even trade up to secure one before they get away. But that\u2019s not the case here.  is coming back.  has arrived.  is in tow.  is an above-average tight end. There\u2019s more than enough here.If not a wide receiver, then what? Perhaps corner fits, especially considering the players that are likely to be on the board at No. 11. Alabama\u2019s Patrick Surtain, Virginia Tech\u2019s Caleb Farley or Jaycee Horn all are worthy of a pick in that range. Sure, the Giants have a star in James Bradberry and spent real money on  But with nickel defense now the base defense of the NFL, three corners are necessary for success.I like Smith, the 2020 Heisman Trophy winner. He\u2019s a smooth route runner. If everything goes perfectly, perhaps he\u2019s Marvin Harrison 2.0. But we\u2019re talking about a best-case scenario for a 170-pound wide receiver. And as for Waddle? He has Tyreek Hill-ish potential, but is coming off an injury-plagued year in college. In a draft so deep at wide receiver, the first round is about special. The odds are that neither Smith or Waddle is truly special.While unlikely, let\u2019s not rule out the Giants passing on a wide receiver for Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons. Although it\u2019s been a while (Parsons opted out of the 2020 season) since we\u2019ve seen the three-down star, it\u2019s not hyperbolic to expect Pro Bowl-level play soon from this player. In a division with dynamic running backs, the Giants could pair Parsons with Blake Martinez for a speedy duo.Is there a natural pass rusher perfect for the Giants scheme that makes sense at No. 11? Perhaps not. But a trade down could work, especially if a team like the Patriots wants to move up for a quarterback falling down the board. Defensive coordinator  schemed up pass rush in 2020, but a young star like Miami\u2019s Jaelan Phillips could help take this defense to another level. Good teams win by rushing the passer, not using top half of the first round picks on wide receivers.
