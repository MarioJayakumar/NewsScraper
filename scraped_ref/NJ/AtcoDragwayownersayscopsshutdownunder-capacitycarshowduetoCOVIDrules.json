At that time, he said, 1,114 people had been let in, including 600 patrons who bought tickets online. People already inside the raceway were permitted to stay, Capone said.\u201cI\u2019m just beside myself. I believe my rights were taken away from me when I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my 3,000 people crowd,\u201d Capone said in a phone interview. \u201cThe word came from the prosecutor\u2019s office and apparently they were claiming we were over capacity and they were told to shut us down.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2014 in addition to state police\u2014 said they assisted in traffic control, but did not make the decision to close down the event and directed questions to Waterford police.Waterford police did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment.A stretch of Jackson Road between Route 73 and Atsion Road in Shamong was closed until 7 p.m., Waterford police said in a   showed a traffic jam on Jackson Road and people tailgating in the parking lots of nearby businesses.Amid the traffic snarl, Victory Sports Bar & Grill on Route 73  they were closing for the afternoon.One attendee, Sierra Warfield, told NJ Advance Media she drove over three-and-a-half hours from Pennsylvania for the show and was one of the last few cars admitted into the venue. Warfield said some of her friends were blocked from entering though.\u201cI am very concerned with how today was handled. As one of the last four cars that managed to make it into the gate, I find myself very lucky,\u201d she said in an email. She said she paid for a ticket and hotel room nearby in advance of Sunday.Around 1,900 patrons who bought pre-sale tickets were turned away, Capone said. In a Facebook post, Elite Tuners said spectators who were not checked in will be automatically refunded and car show registrations not checked in will receive rain-checks for a future event. Capone said ticket prices started at $25 and went up to $65.\u201cWe are very sorry this happened, saying we at capacity when we clearly not,\u201d the company said in the post.The 180-acre Atco Raceway was  to Insurance Auto Auctions, an Illinois based company, which has presented proposals to the town to to turn the property into an auto auction site for used-car sales.
