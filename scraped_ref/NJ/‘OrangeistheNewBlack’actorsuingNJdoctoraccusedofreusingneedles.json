The actor says she has had nothing but problems since, and has been hospitalized up to 30 times since the procedure as a result of recurrent infection.Strauss, she says, is accused of reusing syringes. Castellanos is mystified as to why an experienced doctor would do that.Multiple requests to Hunterdon Medical Center for her medical records have yielded nothing, she says, despite the letter, sent in 2019.\u201cNo one knows what happened to Dr. Strauss,\u201d says Castellanos, 37. \u201cAfter she was terminated it\u2019s like she fell off the face of the earth.\u201dIn April 2020, she sued Strauss, Hunterdon Medical Center, Hunterdon Medical Group and Hunterdon Healthcare for assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress.\u201cI would just like for them to just really take responsibility for what we went through,\u201d Castellanos says of her experience and those of others who were patients of Strauss. She says she has seen evidence of other patients having issues with the doctor in online posts about their treatment.\u201cWhen you go to a doctor you want to be able to trust them,\u201d she says.When the defendants did not respond, Scott Leonard, Castellanos\u2019 lawyer, asked Judge Robert Wilson of Somerset County Superior Court to enter a default judgment.Christina Castellanos, at right, in \"Orange is the New Black.\"According to a court filing, on April 7, 2021, Raymond Fleming, a lawyer for Hunterdon Medical Center, asked the judge to hold off on the default judgment, saying a response would be forthcoming.However, Castellanos has long been dealing with health issues stemming from the breast reduction surgery with Strauss, she says. A few weeks after the surgery, she developed an infection in her breast. That wasn\u2019t the only issue.\u201cIt just didn\u2019t look right,\u201d she says. There was abnormal scarring, and Strauss had to redo the surgery in her nipple area because the left side was lower than the right. Castellanos attributes the outcome to Strauss failing to measure her breasts correctly before the surgery.Later, when she went back to see Strauss to correct the surgery, something didn\u2019t feel right. The doctor performed the second surgery in her office, as opposed to a surgery center. She also noticed the absence of nurses.\u201cThat was a red flag that I felt but I missed because it was all new to me,\u201d Castellanos says, noting that the breast reduction was her first such procedure.Castellanos was also not given sufficient anesthesia, she says.\u201cI was wide awake,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was horrific to see all that blood.\u201dMonths after the surgery, Castellanos had thick scars. Strauss tried to lessen the scarring with a series of injections. But nothing was working, Castellanos says.\u201cMy breasts were just horrible,\u201d she says. \u201cI was ashamed of my body.\u201dShe had her last such injection from Strauss in 2019.\u201cIt\u2019s been ongoing since this incident has happened,\u201d she says of medical issues that have hounded her over the years.Castellanos has since seen another doctor for corrective surgery to redo the reduction. She will soon undergo what she is hoping will be her last related surgery.She says the trauma caused by the first surgery, subsequent procedure and troubling letter from the medical center sent her into therapy.\u201cMentally it has taken a toll on me,\u201d she says.The chronic health problems have affected her work as an actor, Castellanos says.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that by me speaking up about it, (it) can also help other people to get the courage to speak up and that maybe Hunterdon can take some type of responsibility because this is just completely horrific,\u201d she says.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish this upon my worst enemy. It was horrible. It was a nightmare that I still live to this day.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/news/2021/04/orange-is-the-new-black-actor-suing-nj-doctor-accused-of-reusing-needles.html", "date": "2021-04-17161868780110615:30:01"}
