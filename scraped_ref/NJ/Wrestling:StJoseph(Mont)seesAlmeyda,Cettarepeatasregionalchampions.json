{"title": "Wrestling: St. Joseph (Mont.) sees Almeyda, Cetta repeat as regional champions", "body": "2021 NJSIAA / Rothman Orthopaedic North 1 region wrestling tournamentSt. Joseph (Mont.) head coach Tom Farinaro I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve liked to get sophomore 132-pounder Mateo Sgambellone into next weekend\u2019s action in Phillipsburg, but he\u2019ll settle for NJSIAA/Rothman Orthopaedics Regional repeats from his 138 and 145-pounders in junior Alex Almeyda and senior Michael Cetta.The two stole the spotlight as top-seeded Almeyda pinned his way to the title and then beat Bergen Catholic sophomore three seed Christophe Bacchioni by 10-4 decision while for Cetta it was nothing but bonus-point victories en route to his hardware.\u201cAlex and Michael are just on another level right now,\u201d Farinaro said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been training hard and where they\u2019re at given the short season, we\u2019re happy with their progress. One more week.\u201dAlmeyda soaked in the thrill of repeating given the new setting and defeating a program rival in his championship bout.\u201cThe competition was good because there are more kids and teams,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the first weekend of the state tournament pretty much. My main goal was just to go out there and score as many points as possible. It feels good to beat him [Christophe] because there\u2019s always a rivalry between St, Joe\u2019s and Bergen Catholic. I\u2019ve done drills against him but this was my first time wrestling him in a match. He\u2019s a tough kid.\u201dSome seniors get to this stage and wrestle tight and nervous knowing any moment can be their last. That wasn\u2019t the case for the Rutgers-bound Cetta.He came into the day as loose as he could be and didn\u2019t let any second of his bouts go to waste.\u201cI just love going out there and letting it fly to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on my defense, I still try to find ways to get on my offense and score points. At the end of the day, when I\u2019m scoring points, I\u2019m winning matches and feeling good.\u201dWhile Cetta didn\u2019t get wound up, neither did Farinaro.What did he do this afternoon? He kicked back, relaxed and embraced the front-row seat he has to his two standout wrestlers.\u201cI\u2019ve known Alex\u2019s dad for a lifetime and watching his son grow up and wrestle is fun,\u201d he said. \u201cWatching Michael is fun too. These kids work hard, put the time in and deserve the wins they get. Next weekend is it for Michael and hopefully by the end of the night, he\u2019s still standing there.\u201dAlmeyda and Cetta have often shared state title aspirations and next weekend they will get their moment.\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been telling each other every day,\u201d Almeyda said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put on a show.\u201dWhile Boonton head coach Dave Hughen and junior third seed Jason Smith didn\u2019t get the result they wanted in the 145-pound title, his 132-pound junior two seed in Joe Fongaro won at the buzzer, 3-1, on a takedown against Don Bosco Prep senior top seed Kelly Dunnigan.When the official uttered the word \u201ctwo,\u201d all Fongaro could do was smile.\u201cI was just really happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working hard for a while now and it\u2019s starting to pay off. I wish I did better in some matches and positions, but we have another week to work on that. It\u2019s my first and it feels great.\u201dBergen Catholic also advanced two grapplers into the state tournament in the aforementioned Bacchioni and sophomore 145-pound fifth seed Eric Broadie, who took fourth in his bracket.Click our main  for all coverage of North 1 and the other three sites as we have another full day of regional action tomorrow.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/wrestling-st-joseph-mont-sees-almeyda-cetta-repeat-as-regional-champions.html", "date": "2021-04-17161871003716221:40:37"}
