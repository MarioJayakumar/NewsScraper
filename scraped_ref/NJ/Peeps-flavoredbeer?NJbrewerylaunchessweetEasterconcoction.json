(Jeremy Schneider | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)I\u2019m not sure if the Easter Bunny drinks beer. But if he does, there\u2019s a beer right up his alley being brewed in the Garden State. in Little Ferry is celebrating Easter with Get Peep\u2019d \u2014 a New England-style triple IPA brewed with wheat and triple-hopped before being conditioned with marshmallow creme \u2014 inspired by , one of the most popular Easter candies.Get Peep\u2019d has 30% more marshmallow creme than its Get Puft IPA. That\u2019s right, this isn\u2019t even the only marshmallow-flavored beer Brix City makes.\u201cHuge notes of gooey Peeps marshmallow candies, rich vanilla frosting, Sunday mimosas, and ambrosia\u201d are the tasting notes for the beer, according to the Brix City Brewing website.The beer debuted this week and will be available while supplies last \u2014 which the brewery expects won\u2019t be long.\u201cWe saw Easter was coming up, and we were trying to figure out something fun to do,\u201d Brix City Brewing Brand Manager James Foley told NJ Advance Media. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s do like a Peep beer.\u2019 ... It\u2019s just kind of like a fun beer that was inspired by childhood.\u201dI couldn\u2019t decide if that sounded amazing or terrible, so I had to try the creamy, carbonated concoction myself.I had mixed expectations because I have a complicated relationship with Peeps. On one hand, I absolutely love marshmallow candy. I devour chocolate-covered marshmallows and Lucky Charms cereal. I firmly believe a toasted marshmallow is the best part of a s\u2019mores, to the point where I rarely have the patience to make one. I just eat the marshmallow.But I don\u2019t love Peeps! I know that might sound counterintuitive, but there\u2019s something so saccharine sweet about them, and the weird texture, that completely throws me. It made  in 2019 an arduous (and cloying) task. They\u2019re made not far from Jersey by Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \u2014 yes, an Easter candy made in Bethlehem, how fitting. But give me a Cadbury Creme Egg over Peeps any day. Sorry, not sorry.I do love beer, though. And maybe the Peeps beer would be better than the candy! To be fair, beers made with wacky ingredients often have only subtle hints of the flavor.A glass of Get Peep'd, a marshmallow-flavored IPA from Brix City Brewing in Little Ferry. (Jeremy Schneider | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)But wow, there ain\u2019t nothing subtle about the marshmallow flavor in Get Peep\u2019d.The beer smells hoppy yet sweet, and tastes even sweeter. There is an unmistakable sugary kick as soon as you sip it, with an unmistakable marshmallow taste. The typical bitterness of an IPA follows soon after, creating an impressively balanced flavor. This wouldn\u2019t work with many beer types, but IPAs are strong enough to stand up to the sugar.Foley notes that actual Peeps aren\u2019t used in the brewing process. It\u2019s marshmallow creme that\u2019s actually mixed in. But it definitely tastes Peepy.The mouthfeel (snobby enough for you?) was terrific, smooth and fluffy \u2014 almost like a marshmallow. OK, maybe I\u2019m projecting, but it was one of the thicker beers I\u2019ve ever drank, but in a good way.Is it my favorite beer I\u2019ve ever had? Nope. I prefer my beers to taste like, well, beer. But Brix City gets major points for creativity, and I can absolutely see why beer nerds will go crazy for Get Peep\u2019d, and why it will sell out quickly.Now, if anyone could point me in the direction of a Cadbury Cream Ale...Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/food/2021/04/peeps-flavored-beer-nj-brewery-launches-sweet-easter-concoction.html", "date": "2021-04-05161762575281208:29:12"}
