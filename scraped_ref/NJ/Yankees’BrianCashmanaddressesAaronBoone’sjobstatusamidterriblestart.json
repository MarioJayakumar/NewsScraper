Obviously, Aaron\u2019s a piece of that, as am I. But otherwise he\u2019s doing everything he needs to do. He\u2019s cross checking. Whether it\u2019s lineup related, whether it\u2019s how you deploy the troops on the defensive standpoint. \u2026 Obviously he spoke to the team after that tough loss (Friday night). He obviously . So he\u2019s doing everything he needs to do, and most importantly supporting these guys, because we trust our players and we trust their abilities and we trust over the course of time that will, as it normally does, correct itself with a lot more games on the belt. So I think Aaron Boone is doing everything he can do within his power currently.\u201dThe Yankees made the playoffs in each of Boone\u2019s first three seasons, but they faded late last year when they finished 34-26 and now the team is off to its worst start since it was 5-10 in 1997 with Torre managing.\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of trust in the people we have,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the block a long time now and had a number of different managers, a number of different coaches, and they were all faced with the same situation at times on a year in and year out basis. It just comes down to trying to put your players in the best position possible to succeed, give them the best information you can in the simplest terms you can and then letting them play. Stand out of the way and let them play.\u201dThe \u201997 Yankees rebounded to win 96 games and earn a postseason berth as a wild-card team. In 2019, the Yanks began the season 5-8, then went on to win 103 games and advance to the ALCS. Cashman has faith that this season\u2019s club will rebound in a big way, as well.\u201cWhen you have a really talented roster, you just want them to be who they are and what they\u2019re capable of, plug and play and let them go,\u201d the GM said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve got full confidence in our staff because I\u2019ve seen them work a lot of magic along the way, impact a lot of players along the way. I know why you have to ask the question because we\u2019re struggling, and people want to know if changes are coming and stuff. I also want to say that I think I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we\u2019ve had a lot of storms hit along the way.\u201dCashman says Boone will be the manager who gets the Yankees through this storm. The roster won\u2019t be overturned, either.\u201cChange doesn\u2019t happen without a great deal of thought and effort and reason behind it, and we\u2019re not reactive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t see us reacting to how to shake the roster up too quickly and I don\u2019t see us reacting to not believing in the staff that we have and the players that we have, either. And that\u2019s the message to our players \u2018Hey man, we do believe in you. We know what you\u2019re capable of. This is a bad stretch. We\u2019re going to get through this together.\u201cThis isn\u2019t us versus them. This is collectively all of us wearing this, including myself, and we\u2019re going to have to find a way to get through it sooner than later so we can avoid having to feel the way we are right now and having our fans feel the way they are right now.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/yankees-brian-cashman-addresses-aaron-boones-job-status-amid-terrible-start.html", "date": "2021-04-19161886170566915:48:25"}
