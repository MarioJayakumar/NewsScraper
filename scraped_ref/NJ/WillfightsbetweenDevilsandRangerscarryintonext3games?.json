{"title": "Will fights between Devils and Rangers carry into next 3 games?", "body": "New York Rangers, including Rangers center Kevin Rooney (17) and New Jersey Devils players engage in a fight on the ice during the third period of an NHL hockey game, one of several during the night, Tuesday, April 13, 2021, in Newark, N.J. The Rangers shut out the Devils 3-0.It didn\u2019t take long for the heat of the rivalry to emerge between the  and the .Devils defenseman Damon Severson and Rangers forward Chris Kreider fought just 87 seconds into Tuesday\u2019s  at Prudential Center in Newark. Less than six minutes into the second period, two more players dropped the gloves when Devils forward Michael McLeod went after Rangers defenseman Brendan Smith.Under normal circumstances, it would have just been one intense game between the teams before both moved on. But they\u2019ve got three more meetings lined up through Sunday, starting with a game on Thursday at Madison Square Garden in New York.\u201cIt brings emotion up. You see the momentum, I think crowd got going, players got going,\u201d Devils captain  said. \u201cIf you have high emotion, it\u2019s fun to play. I like playing those games, so that was one of them, and obviously it\u2019s we frustrating we lost, but we\u2019ll play them three more times, so looking forward to that.\u201dThe series between the two teams might not have the same juice as an actual playoff series, especially since the Devils are all but out of the playoff race this season. The Rangers are still battling for a spot in the postseason, but they\u2019re currently on the outside looking in with the schedule dwindling.Even if the Devils don\u2019t have a ton to play for in the standings, they\u2019re still looking at these games against the Rangers \u2014 plus upcoming series against the Pittsburgh Penguins and  \u2014 as chances to emerge themselves in playoff-like environments.\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea that you can look at playing these teams a number of times, let\u2019s see if we can win a series,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cNo different than when a baseball team goes and plays another team in a three-game stand or whatever it is. Let\u2019s go out and try to be the winner of each of these individual series we\u2019re about to play.\u201dRuff said he didn\u2019t necessarily think the bad blood between the two teams would carry over game-to-game, but it\u2019s certainly a possibility.The Devils finished on the wrong end of Tuesday\u2019s result, failing to score a goal in a game for just the second time this season. But Hischier saw an engaged team in his first action since Feb. 27, and he expects that aspect to carry through the next three games.\u201cThe emotion didn\u2019t lack out there. The game out there was intense, it was a good rivalry game,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cSo it\u2019s gonna be the same way on Thursday, and those games are fun.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/will-fights-between-devils-and-rangers-carry-into-next-3-games.html", "date": "2021-04-15161848987493408:31:14"}
