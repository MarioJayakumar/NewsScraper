I don\u2019t know that desperation.There are over 19,000 unaccompanied children, mostly Central American, currently being held at our southern border, fleeing violence, death and more. It\u2019s not a good situation. But, they\u2019re alive.I don\u2019t judge their parents. We can\u2019t call ourselves a pro-life nation if we turn these children away.There is general agreement by \u201cFriendly Fire\u201d commentators Mike DuHaime and Julie Roginsky (\u201cGov\u2019s bid to aid immigrants may backfire\u201d) over Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s political interest \u2014 or peril \u2014 in  to New Jerseys\u2019 What goes unsaid is the core economics and social interests involved.Unlike many middle-class taxpayers who have received stimulus checks which go into savings accounts, relief for lower-earning residents supports the local economies where they reside \u2014 that is, small landlords, local and mom-and-pop businesses.Maybe that should also factor into the general calculus before we eligible voters get on our high horses about supposed respect for the law.Gov. Phil Murphy, in another election-year dog-and-pony show, has proposed enacting None of these will reduce the use of illegal firearms.  by gun owners who abide by current firearms laws, and totally ignored by the felons causing gun violence.Murphy said . I wonder if these five cities are controlled by Democrats.Just as Murphy\u2019s 2022 budget proposal makes , and just as he signed legislation this is another election-year ploy to garner votes the expense of taxpayers.No offense to Robert Faulkner, writer of the recent letter,  but I\u2019m glad that Faulkner\u2019s job isn\u2019t running criminal investigations.Sherrill, D-11, has stated she witnessed Republican members of Congress give Capitol tours on Jan. 5 in an apparent effort to help potential pro-Donald Trump rioters scope out the building for the Jan. 6 insurrection, but has not publicly named any lawmakers., but rather, in order to be of any legal value, according to standard procedure and the rules of evidence.But Faulkner\u2019s concern sounds genuine. Perhaps his next letter will demand to see evidence of claims that Joe and Hunter Biden colluded in \u201cUkraine\u2019s interference\u201d in the 2020 election, made by media collaborators and many GOP members of Congress.Meanwhile, we await their public apologies for unsupported claims of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the Benghazi attack, and for  that prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring from the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant..Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/us-cant-turn-its-back-on-unaccompanied-minors-letters.html", "date": "2021-04-18161877504046315:44:00"}
