He\u2019s probably never going to say it, but we know that he\u2019s got to be ticked off about this.\u201dKing referenced a situation in 2014 involving , who at that time was the starting quarterback for the New England Patriots. The Patriots decided to draft  as a potential replacement. Brady never relinquished the starting job and would lead the Patriots to four more Super Bowl appearances while Garoppolo was traded to the San Francisco 49ers.King questioned Wentz\u2019s competitiveness in keeping his starting job in Philadelphia and wondered why he wanted to leave so quickly.\u201cA competitor responds and says you are never, ever taking my job,\u201d King said. \u201cCarson Wentz just said, \u2018Okay you want this guy? Let me get out of here.\u2019\u201dKing also weighed in on former head coach . Pederson, who was fired weeks after the season was over, was not hired by any other team this offseason. King said it could have had something to do with the timing of his firing.\u201cSo many teams were so far down the road or had already committed to coaches,\u201d King said. \u201cTeams did not want to take the time to investigate if something incredible or scandalous happened that led to Doug Pederson not coaching the Eagles anymore. I don\u2019t think it was. I think it was the fact that he, the owner, and the general manager had major differences of opinion about how the team should be run and how the game should be called. I think that\u2019s where it got off the rails.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/eagles/2021/04/nfl-rumors-ex-eagles-qb-carson-wentz-responded-very-negatively-to-jalen-hurts-being-drafted.html", "date": "2021-04-16161861075967118:05:59"}
