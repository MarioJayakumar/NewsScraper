{"title": "How Devils\u2019 Will Butcher handled adverse season with few chances to play | \u2018It\u2019s definitely mentally fatiguing\u2019", "body": "New Jersey Devils defenseman Will Butcher returned to the lineup on Tuesday after not playing since March 6.When the  emerged from their  pause in February,  appeared to finally get his chance.He played in eight games over three weeks, finally cracking the lineup after serving as a  for the first nine games in January.After playing on March 6, he returned to life as a healthy scratch, and Butcher waited for his next opportunity to play. Then he waited, then waited some more.Butcher didn\u2019t appear in a game again until after Monday\u2019s NHL trade deadline, when both  moved to new teams.After being a lineup regular for the first three seasons of his NHL career, where Butcher was a healthy scratch just one time in that stretch, he\u2019s had to adapt to a new role.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely mentally fatiguing. You\u2019re looking to play, maybe get in a back-to-back or whatever the case might be, and it doesn\u2019t happen for a little while,\u201d Butcher said. \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely mentally fatiguing, but the same time I just kept trying to stay ready, put my work in practice, when I got my opportunity to try to make the most of it.\u201dWith the departure of Kulikov and Vatanen, Butcher now appears to be in position to play each of the Devils\u2019 games down the stretch. He\u2019s played in each of the Devils\u2019 past three games.Back in training camp, the competition appeared to be between Butcher and rookie Ty Smith for a lineup spot. Smith\u2019s strong play at the end of the preseason gave him the early chance in the lineup, and he never let it go.So Butcher\u2019s routine has been working in the team\u2019s limited practice to show he\u2019s ready for a chance at regular playing time again\u201cWhen we got practice opportunities, treating my pregame skates like a full-on practice for myself,\u201d Butcher said. \u201cAnd then putting in extra work with our skills coach and just trying to show that you know I had the legs, I had the energy and I guess the drive to get back in that lineup.\u201dButcher is in the second year of a three-year contract he signed in 2019, and he\u2019s slated for unrestricted free agency following the 2021-22 season. At this point, he\u2019s just trying to show what he can bring the Devils on a regular basis.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t gone my way in the sense of getting in the lineup in the beginning of the season and getting a chance here,\u201d Butcher said. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to go out and prove what I can do, what I can do in NHL and what I can do for a team. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for when I\u2019m playing these games and trying to just contribute in any way possible.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/how-devils-will-butcher-handled-adverse-season-with-few-chances-to-play-its-definitely-mentally-fatiguing.html", "date": "2021-04-17161865990311007:45:03"}
