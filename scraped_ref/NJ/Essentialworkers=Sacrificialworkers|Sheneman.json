{"title": "Essential workers = Sacrificial workers  | Sheneman", "body": "You can't eat a fist bump.At the beginning of the pandemic, a certain class of workers was deemed essential to keep society and the economy running, we immediately labeled them essential workers. Besides the first responders charged with aiding and protecting the populace, essential workers came to include the primarily low wage workers in grocery stores, fast food joints, restaurants, meatpacking plants, etc. Basically, the people who have no option to work from home.A majority of these workers are from communities of color and many are undocumented. When the government, both local and federal, swept in with extended unemployment benefits and stimulus money these folks were left out in the cold. We called them essential workers when what we really meant was sacrificial.The argument against extending benefits to undocumented workers is that they are here illegally and don\u2019t pay taxes. The former is irrelevant and the latter is blatantly false. Undocumented workers pay taxes, sales tax, payroll tax, etc. The argument for extending the benefits is that there\u2019s a global pandemic and they are human beings. We are more than willing to exploit their cheap labor to keep the price of boneless skinless chicken breast low, now it\u2019s time to pay up and give something back. On the bright side, there is already bipartisan talk in the legislature about allocating money to help undocumented workers, on the down side, it\u2019s not nearly enough. Murphy\u2019s suggested 40 million dollar fund won\u2019t cut it.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/essential-workers-sacrificial-workers-sheneman.html", "date": "2021-04-16161857440237208:00:02"}
