An integral part of our faith is what we call \u201cTikkun Olam,\u201d to work in partnership with God to \u201crepair the world.\u201d One way we do this is by helping to take care of public spaces like this, to make sure that they\u2019re clean, to protect their natural beauty, so that everyone can enjoy them. We\u2019re glad that we are able to be here to do this.\u201dMany of the synagogue\u2019s volunteer activities are organized through its Tikkun Olam Committee, formed in 2005 to identify ways in which temple members can \u201clend a helping hand,\u201d particularly through social action projects that are intended to make life better for others in the community and beyond. In addition to environmental projects, the committee conducts emergency food drives, houses the homeless, crafts handmade \u201cblankets of love\u201d to provide comfort to children and teens with cancer, and even grows vegetables in their own \u201cmitzvah garden\u201d that they donate to the Westfield Food Pantry.The project was overseen by Betty Ann Kelly, environmental specialist for Union County Parks & Recreations; and Daniela Shebitz, Ph.D., executive director/associate professor at the School of Environmental and Sustainability Sciences at Kean University. \u201cOne of the most important parts about being Jewish is to understand the beauty of our environment and the importance of people as the protectors of the environment,\u201d says Shebitz. \u201cI think that events like this, that bring our congregation together with our community, are really what helps me to express my role in life as a Jewish person.\u201dFor more information on Temple Emanu-El, or to volunteer, contact Jackie Grussgott at .Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/suburbannews/2021/04/temple-emanu-el-volunteers-do-passover-pick-up-of-local-parks.html", "date": "2021-04-09161798318488411:46:24"}
