The former  was trying not to be spotted too soon.Cassandra Izquierdo and Jack Lindsay had no idea what was coming. They were at the Make-A-Wish Foundation in Monroe Township to honor their late daughter, Penelope (a.k.a. Penny), who passed away in February after a battle with neuroblastoma.Penny\u2019s wish was to provide a contribution to Tackle Kids Cancer (TKC), a pediatric cancer research and patient care program through the Hackensack Meridian Children\u2019s Health Children\u2019s Cancer Institute, where Penny received treatment.So Lindsay and Izquierdo, Penny\u2019s parents, were presented with a $10,000 check that would be donated in their late daughter\u2019s honor.Then, Manning popped out to surprise them. (See video above, .)Izquierdo, from Garfield, is a Giants fan, though Lindsay \u2014 a Patriots fan \u2014 is not, \u201cbut he was still shook,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHe was like \u2018Whoa! Wait a minute!\u201d\u201cThis is definitely memorable. We\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet because (Penny) would\u2019ve loved being in this castle. But, she\u2019s here. The sunlight\u2019s here. That\u2019s her.\u201dManning is no stranger to doing work with the Make-A-Wish foundation, especially with how involved the Giants are with the organization. Tuesday was the first time they\u2019d opened the castle to any visitors, and Manning was happy to be a part of it.\u201cThese can be tough moments when you\u2019re dealing with children, pediatric cancer and you\u2019re dealing with Make-A-Wish and you\u2019re giving the last wishes to these kids,\u201d Manning told NJ Advance Media. \u201cBut you understand that you are making an impact on these kids and these families. So a lot of times you hear the stories after from the parents or from the kid that it did lift their spirits a little bit.\u201dManning has worked with Tackle Kids Cancer for more than five years, he said.\u201cSeeing kids go through the chemotherapy and now come out of it better and back home with their family, back in school,\u201d Manning said, \u201cyou see the great work that the research does, that the trials do and that that money is going to good use.\u201dLast year, NJ Advance Media wrote a story about a cancer survivor that once had his wish granted by Make-A-Wish.  with cancer in high school and went through chemotherapy. His wish was to be a Giants season ticket holder, which was granted.Now he\u2019s cancer free and in 2020, got a tattoo on his back of a phrase Manning said at his retirement ceremony: \u201cOnly a Giant.\u201dManning found out after reading NJ Advance Media\u2019s story and, a couple months later, sent Isidori a signed photograph.Penny\u2019s mother is a Giants fan too, and getting the chance to meet Manning on Tuesday \u2014 he hung out with them after the ceremony, too \u2014 was a special moment.\u201cIt just reinforces that we are doing great things\u201d with Tackle Kids cancer, Manning said, \u201cand that we gotta keep up the good work.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/04/watch-giants-eli-manning-surprises-family-with-appearance-at-make-a-wish-in-nj.html", "date": "2021-04-13161836489021421:48:10"}
