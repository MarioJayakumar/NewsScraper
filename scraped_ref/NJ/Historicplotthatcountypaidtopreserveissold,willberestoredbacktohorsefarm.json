John Stafford, the son of the founder, was the personal guard of Continental Army Gen. George Washington during the Revolutionary War, a Camden County statement said.The Stafford family continued to own the property, where it raised horses and farmed, into the 21st Century. In 2004, the development rights for the entire property were sold to the township of Voorhees, the county, state and nonprofit preservation groups for $20.6 million. The entire property is 140 acres. The remaining half of it will stay open space with passive recreational attractions.County officials said protecting the property was worth it.\u201cThe thought by the county, the state, Voorhees township was it was better to preserve the historic property than let it be developed into another strip mall,\u201d Camden County Commissioner Jeff Nash told NJ Advance Media on Friday. \u201cGod knows we didn\u2019t need another strip mall.\u201dGreen becomes only the fourth owner of the farm in its two-and-a-half century history. He expects to restore a track and bring horses back to the property and begin cultivating agriculture.\u201cAcquiring the farm is a passion project for my family and I, and we can\u2019t wait to return this beautiful farmland to the community,\u201d Green said in a statement. \u201cThis is an investment that we plan to keep making for years to come, and we hope to be able to bring groups from the community in and share it with them. I am incredibly thankful that the state and the county preserved this land for the last decade and a half.\u201dDuring the development of Cherry Hill and Voorhees, residential communities and shopping destinations, like the Cherry Hill and Echelon malls, spread rapidly and traditional town centers did not.

Now, Voorhees Mayor Michael Mignogna said he welcomes the restoration of the horse farm.\u201c[Green] was particularly anxious to restore the public\u2019s view of the scenic farm on the corner of Evesham and Springdale Roads,\u201d Mignogna said. \u201cThe scenic vista has returned.\u201dNash said the Stafford family had been getting lucrative offers from developers to sell before the development rights were purchased.\u201cYou cannot have a community that is all developed,\u201d Nash said. \u201cHaving a property like that nearby increases the property values. The county has preserved almost 2,000 acres of open space around Camden County. This is a historic piece of property. There is nothing similar to it in the northern section of Camden County.\u201d  Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/news/2021/04/historic-plot-that-county-paid-to-preserve-is-sold-will-be-restored-back-to-horse-farm.html", "date": "2021-04-17161868802858715:33:48"}
