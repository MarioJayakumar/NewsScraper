{"title": "\u2018We weren\u2019t ready to play\u2019: Why the Devils fell flat in another shutout loss to Rangers", "body": "New York Rangers' Brendan Smith (42) and Libor Hajek (25) combine to check New Jersey Devils' Jesper Boqvist (90) during the second period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, April 15, 2021, in New York.Before the  lost to the  on Tuesday at Prudential Center in Newark, they at least kept things interesting. It was a one-goal game midway through the third period, and one bounce could have flipped the result, despite the Rangers  to open a four-game series between the teams.The Devils needed a heck of a lot more than one bounce to change Thursday\u2019s result.The Rangers scored in the opening minute and two more times in the first period, and the Devils never got close to providing any sort of tangible response in a  at Madison Square Garden in New York.\u201cFirst of all, we weren\u2019t ready to play,\u201d Devils center said. \u201cTwo-nothing early in the game. It\u2019s never easy after that, so some turnovers, some lack of details cost us some goals.\u201dAs disappointing as the Devils\u2019 season has been from a win-loss perspective, the team hasn\u2019t had too many nights like Thursday. Even in games where they\u2019ve fallen behind, they\u2019ve typically provided some sort of response to make things competitive.\u201cWe gave up chances we don\u2019t normally give up. We didn\u2019t have near the energy we had the other night,\u201d Devils head coach Lindy Ruff said. \u201cWhere that energy was, where that lack of effort was, it\u2019s a game that was pretty disappointing for us.\u201dRuff said he didn\u2019t have an explanation for why the team looked so fatigued at times during Thursday\u2019s loss. The Devils are still playing four games per week in their condensed schedule, but they also had a full day off on Wednesday between games.The Devils have now been shutout in back-to-back games after going scoreless in just one game this season prior to this week. On top of struggling to slow down the Rangers\u2019 offense on Thursday, they couldn\u2019t find a way to break out of their scoring rut.\u201cI think sometimes we\u2019re trying to overcomplicate it a little bit,\u201d defenseman Ty Smith said. \u201cJust simplify, get pucks to the net, people to the net and gotta get in front of this goalie\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s playing really well right now.\u201dBecause this is far from a normal season, the Devils will have to provide a response against the same team when they play the Rangers two more times this weekend to close out the season series. The Devils\u2019 captain pointed to everyone in the locker room in the need to flip the script.\u201cEvery individual has to find a spark inside of him to come back and play in a rivalry game,\u201d Hischier said. \u201cDo the extra step, the extra stride, battle, whatever it takes to win the game, and just saying it is not enough. We have to dig in and do it out there.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/devils/2021/04/we-werent-ready-to-play-why-the-devils-fell-flat-in-another-shutout-loss-to-rangers.html", "date": "2021-04-16161857589556308:24:55"}
