{"title": "Costa tosses no-hitter, drives in six in Clearview win (PHOTOS)", "body": "Clearview vs. Deptford baseball, April 19, 2021Julian Costa would not say for sure whether he was being serious or just joking around, but he did predict greatness for himself before his first high school baseball game in almost two years.Then he went out and backed it up.The Clearview senior was sensational both on the mound and at the plate on Monday, as he tossed a no-hitter with 13 strikeouts and drove in six runs to lead the Pioneers past host Deptford, 27-0, in Tri-County Conference inter-division action.\u201cI told everyone before I even came out here I was going to do that,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI mean, I wasn\u2019t sure it was going to happen but I was pretty confident in myself. I just came out, threw strikes and hit the zone. The umpire was a little tight but that happens. My defense helped a little bit behind me and I was focused the whole time.\u201dThe southpaw helped Clearview coach Derrick Reagan pick up his first career victory more than a year after taking the job. Of course, the longtime assistant did not get any opportunities last year since the season was canceled due to the pandemic.The no-hitter and offensive explosion made Reagan\u2019s debut one he will always remember, and the site was also special since he is a 2004 graduate of Deptford.\u201cThis is my alma mater so it\u2019s cool to be here and go against them,\u201d he said. \u201cComing back here brings back a lot of memories. But our guys have been working their butts off and it showed today.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. It\u2019s pretty cool just to be out here coaching this group. Right now we\u2019re not on anyone\u2019s radar and that\u2019s fine with us. We\u2019re just going to play our game and have some fun.\u201dThe Pioneers scored six runs in the top of the first and never looked back. They batted around in every inning of the five-run game except the fourth.Costa went 4-for-6 with two doubles and Jared McKinney went 3-for-4 with a double and four RBI. Abdias Leon-Garcia belted an absolute bomb to straight-away center for a three-run homer and added an RBI single. Nick Mazzagatti, Adam McEvoy, Cole Fowler, Luca Marinucci and Michael Flax also had multiple hits.Clearview took advantage of 14 walks and two hit batters as well.\u201cWe lost some good players who would have definitely contributed and I think we would have gone far last year,\u201d Flax said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad that we have this season. We have a lot of depth and I think we can make a run. Up and down the lineup, and even guys on the bench as you saw today, we can absolutely rake. We had a lot of first hits today and a lot of multiple first hits.\u201dCosta took care of the rest, allowing just three baserunners on walks. The Widener commit allowed Deptford to put only two balls in play, a fly ball to right and a groundout to third.\u201cIt was mostly fastballs. The first two innings that\u2019s all I threw,\u201d he said. \u201cThen after that (Reagan) let me throw a little off-speed and work on some stuff. I guess they couldn\u2019t touch it.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been a phenomenal leader and he\u2019s really matured,\u201d Reagan added. \u201cWe know his ability is there and I think he\u2019s keeping the right mindset, taking the right approach and understanding how to be a better pitcher and not just a thrower. He\u2019s got three good pitches and we didn\u2019t really get a chance to see them today. He just went right after guys and that\u2019s what you do when you have a lead.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/costa-tosses-no-hitter-drives-in-six-in-clearview-win-photos.html", "date": "2021-04-19161887778164220:16:21"}
