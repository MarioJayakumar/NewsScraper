If there\u2019s enough interest, the DEP said it could consider more spots as well.Bidding for each lease begins at $1,800 and mobile sellers of food, non-alcoholic beverages, ice cream and novelties are encouraged to apply. According to the request for bids, the term of the leases will be from as soon as possible after bids are approved through Dec. 31.For all the details, go to .We hope successful bidders will include local and minority- or women-owned operations since one of the broader issues that has come up during discussions of the redevelopment of Liberty State Park\u2019s so-called \u201cinterior\u201d section has been the need for more entrepreneurial opportunities for the people living in the Jersey City neighborhoods just outside the park.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/hungry-for-more-food-choices-in-liberty-state-park-jersey-journal-editorial.html", "date": "2021-04-19161882980428906:56:44"}
