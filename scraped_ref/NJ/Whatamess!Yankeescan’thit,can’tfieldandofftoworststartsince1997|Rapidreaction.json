Yankees can\u2019t hit, can\u2019t field and off to worst start since 1997 | Rapid reaction", "body": "Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole allowed three runs over 6 1/3 innings in a losing effort to the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday at Yankee Stadium.This no longer is just a bad start for the Yankees.It\u2019s become historically awful.The Yankees lost again Sunday, this time with Gerrit Cole starting, and were swept at home by the Tampa Bay Rays, who prevailed 4-2.\u201cBad series,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better.\u201dThis was the Yankees\u2019 fifth loss in a row and left them with a brutal 5-10 record that is a franchise worst after 15 games since they had the same record in 1997 That\u2019s the season Boone debuted in the big leagues as a Cincinnati Reds infielder.Boone isn\u2019t on the hot seat, but Yankees fans let higher-ups know that the team\u2019s play this season has been far below World Series expectations.Cole pitched well again, but he wasn\u2019t perfect and that\u2019s pretty much what Yankees pitchers have to be these days with everyone in the lineup scuffling.With the game tied 2-2, the Rays pulled ahead for good in the seventh against Cole when Joey Wendle singled with one out and Yoshi Tsutsugo followed with an RBI double to the right-center gap.That was it for Cole, who threw a season-high 109 pitches while allowing three runs, two earned, on five hits with 10 strikeouts and no walks.Cole (2-1) took the loss because the Rays pitching once again stymied the Yankees bat. This time, the Yankees were limited to two runs on three hits. For the series, they managed just seven runs and 10 hits in three games.The Yanks\u2019 runs on Sunday came in the second when Giancarlo Stanton hit a leadoff homer and in the sixth when Gio Urshela led off with a double and scored on a two out bloop hit by DJ LeMahieu that made it a 2-2 game.Those were the Yankees only hits off four Rays pitchers \u2014 opener Andrew Kittredge, Ryan Yarbrough (1-2), Diego Castillo and Jeffrey Springs.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to swing the bats better, period,\u201d Boone said.Leading 3-2, the Rays tacked on an insurance run in the ninth when Wendle homered off Yanks reliever Darren O\u2019Day.Once again, the Yankees didn\u2019t play a clean game as the Rays scored an unearned run in a two-run third that included three mistakes by outfielders Aaron Hicks and Clint Frazier.Hicks misjudged a one-on, nobody-out blooper by Kevin Kiermaier that fell in, then bobbled the ball to prevent a flyout or forceout at second. Then Hicks bobbled Yandy Diaz\u2019s run-scoring hit to center for an costly error, because the miscue allowed Kiermaier to go from first to third and score two batters later on a sacrifice fly to left. Frazier wasn\u2019t charged with an error catching that run-scoring flyball, but his wild throw enabled Diaz to go from first to second.For sure, this team is playing terrible baseball.At least the Yankees won\u2019t have to play the Rays again until the second week of May. This Tampa Bay sweep made it 13 wins in its last 16 meetings with the Yankees dating to September 2019, 16 of 21 counting last October\u2019s Division Series.\u201cIt\u2019s just got to get better,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI think we all know that.\u201dYankees first baseman Jay Bruce announced Sunday morning that  He did not play the entire weekend.-- Pitcher  from the alternate site this week and start one of the games next weekend in Cleveland, a four-game set through runs from Thursday to Sunday.-- Gary Sanchez didn\u2019t play Sunday but was available to come off the plate after leaving Saturday\u2019s game with a contusion to his right index and middle fingers that occurred on a foul tip.-- The \u201897 Yankees rebounded from their 5-10 start to have a 96-win season that got them into the playoffs as a Wild Card team.Monday: Off day.Tuesday: Braves at Yankees, 6:35 p.m., YES.
