(Reena Rose Sibayan | The Jersey Journal)A Jersey City restaurant ended its silence on claims and a video that showed an  customers, but the statement has only made some community leaders angrier.In a post on Instagram, the popular Ashford said it is \u201canti-racist\u201d and \u201chas a multi-racial ownership group, a multi-racial staff, and serves a multi-racial community.\u201dThe Downtown eatery had drawn scorn from the community in the past over an initial dress code that appeared to be aimed at keeping out Black customers. The issue was revived Saturday when Charles \u201cCJ\u201d Pace, a 25-year-old Black man, was told he and friends had to eat outside because his \u201cjoggers\u201d violated the restaurant dress code.While finishing his lunch, Pace complained to security and a manager that several white men in similar attire were allowed inside.  He also posted a video on Twitter and Instagram, earning him and his friends widespread support.In its statement Tuesday, The Ashford, co-owned by Kenneth Caulfield and Jeff Lam, also said \u201dWe will take action internally to ensure every team member meets this standard every day.\u201d The note did not say what that action would be.Pace and others were quick to point out that the statement was missing an apology.\u201cTo me, I kind of compared it to when white people say \u2018Oh. I have Black friends,\u201d Pace said. \u201c... You guys aren\u2019t sorry for what happened and what you guys did but you are saying you\u2019re anti-racist. So where\u2019s the apology?\u201dNevin Perkins, the co-founder of the local community group, Black Men United, said he is disappointed, but not surprised by The Ashford\u2019s response.\u201cHow many times will they release an empty statement after their racist procedures get outed, and wait for the situation to blow over,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIf we\u2019ve all learned one thing here it\u2019s that we cannot allow this establishment to rebrand. We must keep shining a light on injustice until they\u2019ve left our city alone.\u201dIn 2019, The Ashford faced claims of racism after it put out a dress code sign that was seen by some as targeting Blacks for  references to oversized jewelry, low and belt-less pants, and headgear. The sign led to outrage on social media platforms and the  sign, called an \u201coversight\u201d by the owners, was removed.City spokeswoman Kimberly Wallace- Scalcione did not respond to a request for comment.City Council President Joyce Watterman said the owners should\u2019ve made an apology because they don\u2019t know how the staff behaved.\u201cSomebody is doing it, so what mechanisms do you have in place to try and identify something like that?\u201d Watterman asked.Downtown Councilman James Solomon said The Ashford\u2019s statement didn\u2019t go nearly far enough.\u201cFirst there\u2019s no apology to the people discriminated against,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cSecond the problem isn\u2019t just racism; it was anti-Black racism, and it needs to be named as such. And third, we need specifics on what they are going to do to meet (their) \u2018standard.\u2019 \u201dbeing black in america is being told you can\u2019t come inside of an establishment because you have on sweatpants but you can sit outside, and as you sit outside you watch white people walk smoothly inside with sweatpants and hats to the back. dont support TheAshFord in JerseyCityNJ Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2021/04/under-fire-jersey-city-restaurant-says-its-anti-racist-in-statement-slammed-by-community-leaders.html", "date": "2021-04-13161834673046416:45:30"}
