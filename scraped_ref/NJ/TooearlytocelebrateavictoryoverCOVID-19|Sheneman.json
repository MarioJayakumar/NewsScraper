{"title": "Too early to celebrate a victory over COVID-19 | Sheneman", "body": "Stretch for it.It\u2019s tough to strike a balance when writing about COVID-19. I want to highlight the positives \u2014 vaccination rates, efficacy, etc. \u2014 while at the same time letting people know it\u2019s not over yet. The end result is that you end up sounding like an insufferable doomsayer.We\u2019re at the goal line, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel \u2014 pick whichever cliche you like \u2014 but we\u2019re close to coming out the other side of this. It\u2019s now a race between the variants and our ability to get people vaccinated and thankfully, we\u2019re sticking needles in arms at a greater rate than we expected. Turns out a baseline of competence at the top makes a huge difference.Here\u2019s the party pooper part: Despite the accelerating vaccine rates many more people are going to die before this is over. Seeing the finish line isn\u2019t the same as crossing it. In Super Bowl XXVII Cowboys defensive lineman Leon Lett recovered a fumble at his own 35 and set to running it the length of the field for the presumptive touchdown only to have Buffalo wide receiver Don Bebee chase him down from behind and smack the ball out of his hand before Lett broke the plane of the goal line. Lett, an otherwise tremendous player, would fail to score and be forced to live down the embarrassment for the rest of his career. The Cowboys won anyway (Boo!) but the lesson remains the same: Score first, celebrate later.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/too-early-to-celebrate-a-victory-over-covid-19-sheneman.html", "date": "2021-04-15161848885095108:14:10"}
