(Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media)Now we\u2019re really not okay.Beloved New Jersey emo-punks  announced Friday afternoon the band has again postponed its reunion tour, which was set to include a home-state show at Newark\u2019s Sept. 21. \u201cWe are deeply sad, but those emotions are only a fraction of the depth of feeling we\u00a0have all experienced watching the suffering and loss of the past year,\u201d the band wrote on \u201cWe just want to be as sure as we can be that everyone is safe.\u201d The tour, originally booked for fall 2020, is now set for 2022. The new Prudential Center date will be Sept. 20. All tickets will be honored. Refunds are available at point of purchase. The famed group, native to Belleville and Kearny and famous for its mid-2000s crossover hits \u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise),\u201d \u201cHelena\u201d and \u201cWelcome to the Black Parade,\u201d is just the latest outfit to push their performances another year as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and state-mandated capacity limits remain low. New Jersey\u2019s capacity limits for venues of 2,500 seats or more (Prudential Center holds about 15,000 for a concert) is a mere 20%. The arena began hosting low-capacity Devils hockey games last month. The Weeknd, Steely Dan and others have also again moved tours originally slated for 2020. More postponements are likely to follow. At least some good news came Thursday when Newark\u2019s New Jersey Performing Arts Center announced it  for indoor performances. NJPAC will be the first major New Jersey venue to require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test from its patrons.
