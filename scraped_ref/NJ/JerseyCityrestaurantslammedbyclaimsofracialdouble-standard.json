(Reena Rose Sibayan | The Jersey Journal)A Downtown Jersey City hot spot called out two years ago for a discriminatory dress code sign is being slammed again \u2014 after a video showing an apparent double-standard for Black and white customers was posted on social media.Charles \u201cCJ\u201d Pace, 25, said he and his two friends \u2014 who are Black \u2014 went to The Ashford on Newark Avenue Saturday for lunch and he was told he could not eat inside because he was wearing \u201cjoggers\u201d sweatpants, a violation of the dress code.As the three finished their meals, Pace watched as several white men in similar attire \u2014 and one with a baseball cap on backwards \u2014 walked past security into the restaurant without so much as a second glance.\u201cI understand. I follow dress codes, but if it is blatantly in my face being (racist), you know what I mean?\u201d Pace said. \u201cIt really set me off.\u201dCo-owners of The Ashford, Kenneth Caufield and Jeff Lam, did not respond to requests for comment.Pace, owner of a photography studio in Journal Square, a model and YouTube influencer, brought up the double-standard to the head of security, who told him he still wouldn\u2019t be allowed inside. Pace then spoke with a manager, who told the group they were being \u201caggressive.\u201d\u201cHe was downplaying the entire thing,\u201d Pace said. \u201cHonestly, it looked like he just wanted to laugh at us.\u201dThe video has more than 541,000 views on Twitter, where support for Pace and his friends has been overwhelming.being black in america is being told you can\u2019t come inside of an establishment because you have on sweatpants but you can sit outside, and as you sit outside you watch white people walk smoothly inside with sweatpants and hats to the back. dont support TheAshFord in JerseyCityNJ \u201cAs one (of two) black girls that worked here, we dealt with a lot of bulls---, but it\u2019s always been known knowledge that they didn\u2019t sell (Hennessey) or Ciroc (because) they didn\u2019t want \u201cthat crowd.\u201d ... I\u2019ve spoken (with) the bouncers and they\u2019ve told them not to let certain types in,\u201d one person said in response to the video.Keziah Jones, 26, one of Pace\u2019s two friends at the Downtown restaurant, said a great time was ruined \u2014 especially after she and Pace overheard the head of security telling the manager a completely different story about what transpired.\u201cWe were all so excited, so happy and joyful and then that happened ... It definitely made me angry,\u201d Jones said.Pace said The Ashford has not responded to his posts on Twitter and Instagram, but it has shut down its comments section on its Instagram page after multiple comments about the incident.In 2019, that was seen by many as racially specific for bans on clothing items like oversized jewelry, low and belt-less pants, and headgear. Caulfield said at the time that the sign was \u201can oversight\u201d and the bar\u2019s dress code is simply \u201ccasual neat\u201d and \u201cdress to impress,\u201d and has \u201cnothing to do with race whatsoever.\u201dNevin Perkins, the co-founder of the local community group, Black Men United, said the racist incident is a \u201creflection of the settler culture\u201d in Downtown Jersey City.\u201cGentrification in Jersey City has created a space where folks are pushed out of their neighborhoods, by a population the city government seems to prioritize,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cAfter being pushed out of the area, folks are then denied access to establishments in the neighborhood, effectively being banned from any access to the most attended area of Jersey City. ... Those to blame have to be held accountable.\u201dCity Council President Joyce Watterman said she is disappointed in The Ashford. \u201cThe only way things like that stop happening is if people start speaking out about it more and more,\u201d Watterman said.Downtown Councilman James Solomon called the alleged conduct completely unacceptable. \u201cThe Ashford needs to immediately take action to be sure there is no racism or discrimination at their club.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2021/04/jersey-city-restaurant-slammed-by-claims-of-racial-double-standard.html", "date": "2021-04-12161826299607317:29:56"}
