{"title": "Lawmakers grill MVC chief about canceled appointments, closures", "body": "The pause on administering the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines has delayed getting state Motor Vehicle Commission employees vaccinated to r for drivers, said Sue Fulton, MVC chief administrator, on Monday.Vaccinating MVC workers is seen as a way to end the frustrating number of agencies closing for a 14-day quarantine after employees test positive for the coronavirus, said Fulton, who testified before the assembly budget committee Monday.Federal Food and Drug Administration officials temporarily suspended the administration of the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine last week after reports of some very rare blood clot cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci said by the end of this week.The suspension put the brakes on the MVC\u2019s program to vaccinate its front line staff in agencies as a way to end agency closures, Fulton said.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on getting the vaccinations done, so we can stop the closures,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cThe Department of Health and the governor\u2019s office are working closely with us and providers to re-start our program and expedite to the finish.\u201dThe MVC completed 4 of 14 total scheduled days of vaccinations, said William Connolly, an MVC spokesman.On Monday, seven of the state\u2019s 39 MVC agencies were closed for quarantine and sanitizing due to employees testing positive for COVID-19. But , which results in canceling drivers\u2019 appointments.Drivers have complained to lawmakers\u2019 legislative offices for help. Many of those legislators had sharp criticism and pointed advice for the MVC\u2019s boss, saying the MVC\u2019s appointment system was second worst in the state, after the  unemployment system.\u201cPeople are calling me, crying. It\u2019s an awful situation,\u201d said Assemblywoman Serena DeMasio, R-Monmouth, to Fulton. You need to fix it now.\u201dFulton testified with Transportation Commissioner Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti and NJ Transit CEO Kevin Corbett to the assembly budget committee for close to three hours Monday. But legislators put the MVC on the hot seat, asking Corbett to curtail his remarks so they could hear from Fulton.\u201cIt seems to be excuse after excuse, you need to get your act together,\u201d said DeMasio, after mentioning there were \u201czero\u201d appointments to get a Real ID drivers license when she went online during the hearing. \u201cMy staff gets calls from people who can\u2019t get their (unemployment) money with a license to provide who they are. It\u2019s unacceptable and frustrating.\u201dBudget Committee Chairwoman, Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Martin, D-Essex, said her constituents have similar issues about getting an MVC appointment.\u201cI want you to understand, when we\u2019re getting these calls, they\u2019ve already called you and they are at level 10 (of frustration),\u201d Pinter-Martin said. \u201cThere are people still trying and the appointment system is backed up till June.\u201d There are literally no appoints available at any of the offices to obtain a learner's permit. And when calling the number listed, the outgoing message is \"too busy... call back later\". Can you make a suggestion on how to magically secure an appointment? Thx!In addition to constituents who lack access to a computer or internet access, she cited language barriers as issues that have made it hard to schedule an appointment.\u201cIn my district we\u2019re scheduling appointments for some people. They are not internet savvy and it\u2019s not an easy system to navigate,\u201d Pintor-Martin said. \u201cIs there something your department is doing to be helpful, opening another shift and helping people schedule them?\u201dShe asked the MVC to add a second or third shift to open more appointments. DeMasio asked why the MVC isn\u2019t adhering to the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s latest advice that a 10-day quarantine is all that is needed.The MVC doesn\u2019t have enough employees to add additional shifts and the state Department of Health told the MVC to continue using the 14-day quarantine period, instead of the 10-day CDC recommendation, Fulton said.\u201cI\u2019ve got every person dedicated to doing transactions that I can,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cAdding another shift isn\u2019t going to help because I don\u2019t have more people.\u201dSouth Brunswick Vehicle Center is unexpectedly short-staffed today. We will honor as many appointments as possible. Any customer who is not served or who is willing to voluntarily return will be given a courtesy appointment for any day next week.The MVC is at the 35% to 40% staffing, due to people on sick leave, family leave, those quarantining and people who\u2019ve quit, she said. Despite that, she said that 80% of business with the MVC can be done online, but  Fulton said.Assemblyman Harold J. Wirths R-Sussex, was skeptical and asked why the MVC is closing agencies when an employee tests positive, but supermarkets and large retail stores remain open.\u201cI can\u2019t understand the constant closures. What is breaking down that isn\u2019t at supermarkets?\u201d he said. \u201cTo assume everyone in the agency has COVID is an extreme measure and unnecessary.\u201dThe reason is that MVC employees work in much closer quarters than supermarket workers and that agencies are smaller, Fulton said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the space behind the counter that you have in the retail or school environment,\u201d she said.In February, MVC officials said the agency caught up with the backlog of millions of transactions that mounted while locations were closed during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. It , including almost all vehicle registrations and standard license renewals. Agency visits were restricted to business that can be done only in person.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/news/2021/04/lawmakers-grill-mvc-chief-about-canceled-appointments-closures.html", "date": "2021-04-19161887744700020:10:47"}
