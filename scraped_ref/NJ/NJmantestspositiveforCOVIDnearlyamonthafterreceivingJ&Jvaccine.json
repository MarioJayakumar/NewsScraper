A New Jersey man has been hospitalized with COVID-19 despite receiving Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose coronavirus vaccine last month, reports say.Francisco Cosme, 52, of Edison, developed pneumonia weeks after receiving the inoculation March 6, according to . He tested positive for the virus April 1, nearly a month after getting his shot.He remains in critical condition at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison.Since the vaccine rollout began, many have wondered if people can contract the virus after being immunized. Experts and officials say while it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s not common.New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said Monday during a coronavirus media briefing that the state is aware of Cosme situation.\u201cIt will happen,\u201d Persichilli said. \u201cThe efficacy could be close to 100%, but there are also a percentage of cases that are either (they) contracted COVID-19 before they got vaccinated or were exposed afterward and will fall ill.\u201dGov. Phil Murphy was unaware of the case, but hopes the public doesn\u2019t misinterpret the outlier as the norm.\u201cThere are so few cases in Jersey, in the country, in the world where someone has been infected after the vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just not want anyone out there to assume that that\u2019s the norm, because it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no data at all that suggests that.\u201dAccording to the , Cosme continued to wear a mask and maintain social distancing even after getting his shot.But on April 1, he began to feel fatigued,  reported. He was also congested, had a sore throat and developed a fever.He underwent a test that same day, the report said, and it came back positive.Last week, his symptoms grew worse, according to the Post. The report said his daughter \u2014\u00a0who was visiting her father at the time \u2014 called 911, and he was transported to Kennedy Medical Center.Eddy Bresnitz, medical advisor for the state department of health, addressed these so-called \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases at an April 7 coronavirus briefing.\u201cWe know from the pivotal trials, the Phase 3 trials, that vaccines like the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccine, for example, they prevented \u2014 and the Johnson vaccine \u2014 prevented severe disease and hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d Brensnitz said. \u201cThere will be cases of breakthrough disease if not in New Jersey, throughout the country and elsewhere.
