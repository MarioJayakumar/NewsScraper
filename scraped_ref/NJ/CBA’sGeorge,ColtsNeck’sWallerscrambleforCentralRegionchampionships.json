I felt like there was no reason why I couldn\u2019t come back from a 2-0 deficit.\u201dGeorge escaped with 1:03 left in the first period, then tied the score, 2-2, with another escape early in the second period. Then, with 39 seconds left in the second period, George emerged from a scramble behind Maida for the winning points.In the third period, George gave a magnificent riding effort. Using the leverage created by his height, George kept his weight forward and Maida pinned to the mat.\u201cBetween my CBA practices and what we do at Triumph (Wrestling Club), I\u2019ve been given college-level technique so I can wrestle like someone with my body type.\u201dGeorge wrestled with boots in and boots out, coming off the hips enough to avoid a single stalling call.George made a major leap from a third-place finish in Region 6 to a first-place finish.\u201cI reached the blood round in the state tournament and I suffered the toughest loss ever,\u201d George said. \u201cI came into this season hungry.\u201dIn the 145 pound final, Garrett Waller of Colts Neck was on the verge of defaulting out of the bout. He picked himself up off the mat after a hard landing on the back of his neck, scored an escape and a takedown in a 21-second span and won the Central Region title, 6-4, over top-seeded Kamrin O\u2019Neill of Matawan.Waller was given a five-minute recovery period, he used a good chunk of it.\u201cThe trainers were checking me out and they\u2019re saying \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Waller said. \u201cI told them both, I\u2019m wrestling.\" I had no doubt in my mind I was going to continue,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t come this far, just to come this far.\u201dThe aggressive takedown by O\u2019Neill was first ruled a slam, but was then changed to potentially dangerous call after discussion between the referee and mat judge.When the bout resumed, Waller trailed O\u2019Neill, 3-1.\u201cWhen we restarted, I put my head down literally and metaphorically, because, you know, it hurt,\u201d Waller said. \u201cMy parents haeve been telling me all week to make a statement.Waller did, without saying a word. He exploded from the bottom for an escape then came off a head tie to score a takedown on the edge.\u201cI kept telling myself, I wasn\u2019t going to lose here,\u201d Waller said.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/cbas-george-colts-necks-waller-scramble-for-central-region-championships.html", "date": "2021-04-17161870862166621:17:01"}
