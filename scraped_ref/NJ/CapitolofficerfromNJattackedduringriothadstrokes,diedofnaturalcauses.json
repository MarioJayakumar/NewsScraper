Diaz, said the officer suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body.The autopsy found no evidence Sicknick suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, which Diaz said would have caused Sicknick\u2019s throat to seize. And he said there was no evidence Sicknick had internal or external injuries, and while noting Sicknick\u2019s presence during the rioting, said \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition,\u201d the reported.Diaz told the Post he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition, citing privacy laws.A woman who answered the door at a New Jersey address listed for Sicknick\u2019s parents declined to talk with a reporter.Sicknick was a Capitol police officer for 12 years when he died. Before moving to the Washington area, he was a member of the New Jersey Air National Guard and twice deployed overseas.On Jan. 6, he was directly involved with rioters, and a statement from his department said he collapsed that night. He died the next day, \u201cdue to injuries sustained while on-duty...and was injured while physically engaging with protesters.\u201dAn autopsy and full investigation, though, was ongoing for about two months. In mid March, federal authorities announced they\u2019d charged Khater, 32, and Tanios, 39, with assaulting him with an irritant, possibly bear spray, which Tanios bought in West Virginia on Jan. 5.The New York Times later published  in the moments before and after spraying Sicknick on the Capitol grounds. \u201cGive me that bear s---,\u201d Khater says, and appears to reach into Tanios\u2019 backpack. He then sprays three officers, Sicknick reacts, turns and is later is shown bent over and using water to wash off his face.Khater and Tanios remain in federal custody pending trial in Washington, D.C.Tanios now lives in Morgantown, West Virginia, with his fiancee and three children, and runs a sandwich shop.Khater ran Frutta Bowls franchises in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and State College, Pennsylvania before returning to New Jersey recently, where he was arrested on the Capitol crimes charges.Sicknick lived in Springfield, a northern Virginia suburb of the nation\u2019s capital, with his girlfriend of 11 years. He rescued dachshunds in his spare time and never stopped rooting for the New Jersey Devils.He was laid to rest after being honored in the Capitol rotunda Feb. 3 during a solemn ceremony in which his fellow officers and  - and  - paid their respects and passed by his remains, next to an American flag.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/middlesex/2021/04/capitol-officer-from-nj-attacked-during-riot-died-of-natural-causes-medical-examiner-says.html", "date": "2021-04-19161887203216318:40:32"}
