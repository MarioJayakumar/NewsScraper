Yet, as an undocumented immigrant, she's doesn't qualify for any COVID-19 aid payments. Last week, she and other essential workers started a multi-day fast/hunger strike to protest that policy. Photo provided by Make the Road NJ, which is helping organize the fast.Like many immigrants, I\u2019ve worked throughout the pandemic to keep my family afloat. I\u2019m an essential worker. I work in a supermarket in Elizabeth as a cashier. During the worst months of the pandemic, when everyone around us was getting sick, I worked every day. I worried night and day that I would get sick, or worse, bring the virus home to my husband and three kids. I have a pre-existing condition and I didn\u2019t think I would survive COVID-19 if I became ill.I didn\u2019t have the choice to stay home if I felt at risk or nervous about my health. Because of my immigration status, I\u2019m ineligible for unemployment and the stimulus payments. It\u2019s frustrating to be left behind from a system I\u2019ve contributed to every week since I started working at the grocery store five years ago. In each of my paychecks, I pay into unemployment. But I could never collect if I lost my job. I also have paid my taxes every year since I came with my family from Uruguay, eight years ago.My husband lost his job in construction during the shutdown and we had to survive on my wages alone. We struggled to make ends meet. I became the sole provider for our family. Without the stimulus check and without his income or any unemployment it was difficult to pay rent or to keep up with bills.Over Thanksgiving, when we wanted to have a meal together, it was difficult to have enough food to go around. Presents were scarce for Christmas. We were scrambling just to pay the rent and pay for my medication, which I need to take every day.My work at the grocery store during the pandemic has helped the rest of the state to stay at home and quarantine. I fed so many during the pandemic, but when my family was suffering, no one provided for us.A half-million immigrants in New Jersey \u2014 about half of whom are essential workers who have done the work to clean, cook and prepare our food during the pandemic \u2014 are excluded from all aid. Over the past 10 years, undocumented immigrantsto our unemployment system. Every year we pay more than $ billion in federal taxes and nearly $600 million in state and local taxes. But we haven\u2019t received any relief.When I\u2019m not working, I have been organizing a campaign to push for COVID-19 relief for immigrants and other excluded workers like me. We have held more than 30 rallies up and down the state. We\u2019ve met with dozens of members of Congress and state legislators, organized call-in days and reached more than 100,000 Latino voters to urge them to call their representatives to demand relief. But still, a year later, we have nothing.This week, I\u2019m joining a fast lead by immigrant essential workers like me to demand relief. We can\u2019t go on like this \u2014 now, for more than a year. You could say that I\u2019ve been hungry for a year \u2014 and I\u2019m making this sacrifice this week because I want to show our state what we are willing to give to have our humanity, our work and our dignity recognized.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/im-fasting-because-immigrants-like-me-need-help-during-the-pandemic-opinion.html", "date": "2021-04-11161818973450321:08:54"}
