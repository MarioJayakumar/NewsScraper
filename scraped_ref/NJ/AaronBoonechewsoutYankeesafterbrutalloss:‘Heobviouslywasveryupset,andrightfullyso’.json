{"title": "Aaron Boone chews out Yankees after brutal loss: \u2018He obviously was very upset, and rightfully so\u2019", "body": "Yankees manager Aaron Boone sternly addressed his struggling ballclub after Friday night\u2019s 8-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. manager Aaron Boone dropped his easygoing, positive demeanor after watching Friday\u2019s night game.About time.All it took was three hits, three errors, lousy pitching and yet another loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. has one of baseball\u2019s World Series favorites dealing with an 5-8 record 13 games in.After the final out, Boone went straight to the home clubhouse at Yankee Stadium, called a team meeting and let his players hear it.Boone only would admit that he addressed his team and did not reveal his message \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s for in there,\u201d he said \u2014 but two of his players provided details during post-game interviews.For starters, Boone clearly was not calm in his meeting, which lasted just a few minutes.\u201cHe was obviously very upset, and rightfully so,\u201d designated hitter  said.Added left fielder , \u201cHe\u2019s so chill that when he does address us the way that he does (when he\u2019s upset), everyone should listen because he\u2019s not the kind of guy that really gets that upset. So I think your ears perk up a little bit more. I think everyone\u2019s going to come ready to go (Saturday), and maybe we needed Boonie to address us that way for it to happen.\u201dBoone was upset that Yankees hitters aren\u2019t working pitchers like they usually do. Their 3.85 runs per game ranks 13th among 15 AL clubs. He\u2019s also angry that his fielders are giving opponents far too many extra outs. Their 11 errors in 13 games are worse than 2020 when the Yanks led the AL with 48 in 60 games.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be successful,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI have the utmost confidence in this roster, in this team. We just have to start playing better, period. Right now we just have to really focus on our individual crafts \u2014 me, our coaches \u2014 making sure we\u2019re getting our guys ready to be the best they can and put them in a position to go out and let their talent take over.\u201cWe\u2019re making sure we\u2019re paying attention to details when we show up each and every day. The results will follow. They\u2019ll be there. We\u2019re just going through a tough stretch right now.\u201dThe Yankees had just three hits in Friday\u2019s loss, a two-run, seventh-inning homer by Stanton that cut into an 8-0 Rays lead plus singles by Gleyber Torres and Gio Urshela. This was the seventh time in 13 games that the Yanks were held to three or fewer runs. They\u2019re 1-6 in those games.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely underperforming,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cDefinitely the offensive side, which is me a big part of. And some of the guys will tell you they haven\u2019t played the way they\u2019d like to, as well. We\u2019ve got to pick it up.\u201dBoone told his team that it has to start Saturday when the Yankees have the difficult task of facing Rays ace Tyler Glasnow in a 1:05 p.m., game. Win this one, then the Yanks will have Gerrit Cole on the mound Sunday with a chance to win the series.\u201c(Boone) addressing us \u2026 I think everyone took the thought we have to come to the ballpark (Saturday) ready to go because the team that we\u2019re playing is going to come ready to go,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into everything that (Boone) said, but we need to come ready to go. That that was the message that I took from it.\u201dFrazier is a fan of Boone\u2019s managing style.\u201cBoone\u2019s our guy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen things are going good, he\u2019s going to be there for us. And when things are going bad, he\u2019s going to try to get us back to where he knows as a coach where we should be. I think hearing it from him is a little bit different from hearing it from players sometimes because Boonie is one of the most positive guys behind the scenes for us.\u201cWhen we show up to work, he makes it a fun, but a working environment, too. We\u2019re here to win ballgames, and when he recognizes and anyone recognizes that we aren\u2019t playing well, it should be addressed. And it was needed.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2021/04/aaron-boone-chews-out-yankees-after-brutal-loss-he-obviously-was-very-upset-and-rightfully-so.html", "date": "2021-04-17161866170050908:15:00"}
