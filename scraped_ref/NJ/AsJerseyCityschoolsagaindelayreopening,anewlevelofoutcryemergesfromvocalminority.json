{"title": "As Jersey City schools again delay reopening, a new level of outcry emerges from vocal minority", "body": "Jenn Sforza, of Jersey City, is planning a protest for Thursday to protest the superintendent's decision to keep school buildings closed to students.Jenn Sforza had been patient with the Jersey City school district as it remained fully virtual, trusting that there were valid reasons for the decision and hopeful that it would reopen before the end of the school year.Then yesterday she learned it wouldn\u2019t, and she lost her patience.\u201cI think this time around it hits a little bit harder because now us parents are seeing more and more districts opening up,\u201d said Sforza, whose son attends School 37. \u201cVery close to us North Bergen is opening up, Union City, so these are close-to-home school districts opening up \u2026 and I think this time around we were so hopeful.\u201dSforza isn\u2019t alone.About 20% of parentshad informed the school district that they would send their children back the week of April 26 if schools reopened, and some are calling Superintendent Franklin Walker\u2019s decision a failure in leadership.Others have applauded the district\u2019s decision, arguing it prioritizes safety and is the most prudent thing to do as the pandemic wears on.\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush in going back to in-school learning?\u201d Chester Florendo wrote in the Jersey City Public Schools District Facebook group. \u201cWe can go back to in-school in Sept when everything is ready.\u201dStudents had a similar range of emotions, with the youngest not knowing what they\u2019re missing since they\u2019ve never experienced in-person schooling.Jackie Cox\u2019s 6-year-old twins Marty and Olney said that by the end of the school day their eyes hurt from looking at the screen.\u201cI miss school,\u201d Marty said.\u201cI like watching TV, but the school screen is a teenie bit brighter and it hurts our eyes,\u201d Olney chimed in.Cox, a parent of four who works full time, has been advocating for schools to reopen for months. After the announcement Sunday night, she saw a flood of parents request to join a Facebook group she founded for the cause with several other parents.Marty and Olney can\u2019t yet form letters despite her bringing in a tutor, and when she told them they would be finishing kindergarten from home, they weren\u2019t that upset, she said.\u201cAs someone who wants your child to be excited about school and to love their teacher and get excited about their work, to have them be so withdrawn \u2026 it\u2019s alarming,\u201d said Cox, who lives in Paulus Hook.Sforza said her 10-year-old son is enrolled in a self-contained class at Cordero Community Schoolsince he is on the autism spectrum. His teacher \u201cis an absolute angel,\u201d she said, but virtual schooling can\u2019t compete with in-person, and it requires constant parenting.After joining the \u201cOpen Jersey City Schools Now!\u201d Facebook group, she decided to start her own initiative: a rally. She plans to hold it Thursday morning at the Board of Education building.\u201cMy hope is that we can rally together and just say \u2018enough,\u2019\u201d the McGinley Square resident said.Deanna Hernandez-Arza wasn\u2019t planning on sending her children back to school, but said she knows why other parents are frustrated.\u201cI wish the communication was better,\u201d she said of the superintendent. \u201cI wish that he was a little bit more open with where he\u2019s leaning.\u201dNikeeta Sarang\u2019s 3-year-old son currently only has one hour of schooling a day, for which she joins him while working from home. As a single parent, she\u2019s had to hire a nanny, but it still concerned that her work performance is suffering, she said.Many parents who can\u2019t assist their children during school were also hoping to send their children back, said Mariana Aciar, who lives in Bergen-Lafayette.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very Latino community and a lot of the parents don\u2019t speak English \u2026 but in the neighborhood I talk to them and they\u2019re ready to have the kids for some kind of in person learning,\u201d Aciar said.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2021/04/as-jersey-city-schools-again-delay-reopening-a-new-level-of-outcry-emerges-from-vocal-minority.html", "date": "2021-04-19161886839185117:39:51"}
