The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.Coronavirus restrictions meant that instead of the 800 mourners expected in the longstanding plans for Philip\u2019s funeral, only 30 people were allowed inside the castle\u2019s St. George\u2019s Chapel, including the queen, her four children and her eight grandchildren.Following strict social distancing rules during the pandemic, the queen set an example even in grief, sitting apart from family members who were arrayed around the church.Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, sat opposite the monarch alongside his wife, Camilla. Prince Andrew was two seats to the queen\u2019s left. Prince William and his wife, Kate, sat directly opposite from his brother, Prince Harry, who had traveled back from California without his pregnant wife, Meghan.People across Britain observed one minute of silence in honor of Philip just before the funeral got underway. Under soft spring sunshine, some locals earlier stopped outside the castle to leave flowers, but people largely heeded requests by police and the palace not to gather because of the pandemic.Philip\u2019s coffin traveled to the chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover designed by the prince himself. The coffin was draped in his personal standard and topped with his Royal Navy cap, sword and a wreath of flowers.For the procession, senior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle. The children of Philip and the queen \u2014 Charles, Princess Anne, Andrew and Prince Edward \u2014 walked behind the hearse, while the 94-year-old queen traveled to the chapel in a Bentley car.Grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry also walked behind the coffin, although not side by side. The brothers, whose relationship has been strained amid Harry\u2019s decision to quit royal duties and move to California, flanked their cousin Peter Phillips, the son of Anne.For many viewers, the moment stirred memories of William and Harry at 15 and 12, walking behind the coffin of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather Philip, in a London ceremony televised around the world.Later Saturday, the two brothers were seen walking together and chatting as the mourners left the chapel after the service.The funeral reflected Philip\u2019s military ties, both as a ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of war. More than 700 military personnel took part, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.Inside the Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, the service was simple and somber.The ceremony began with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby entering the chapel ahead of the coffin, followed by Philip\u2019s children and three of his eight grandchildren, as a four-member, socially distanced choir sang \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.\u201dThere was no sermon, at Philip\u2019s request, and no family eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition. But Dean of Windsor David Conner said the country had been enriched by Philip\u2019s \u201cunwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith.\u201dPhilip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral had a maritime theme, including the hymn \u201cEternal Father, Strong to Save,\u201d which is associated with seafarers and asks God: \u201cO hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.\u201dLeading a prayer, Conner said: \u201cGrant unto him the assurance of thine ancient promise that thou wilt ever be with those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters.\u201dAs Philip\u2019s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded \u201cAction Stations,\u201d an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle. Its inclusion, after the traditional bugle call of \u201cThe Last Post,\u201d was a personal request from Philip.Philip was placed in the vault alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including three kings of England. But it will likely not be his permanent resting place. After the queen\u2019s death, she and Philip are expected to be buried in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.Along with Philip\u2019s children and grandchildren, the 30 funeral guests included other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and, like the queen, is\u00a0.Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual photo was a favorite of the queen.For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife\u2019s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.\u201cHe was a character, an absolute character,\u201d said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. \u201cHe was fun, he was funny. Yes, he made quite a few gaffes, but it depends which way you took it, really. Just a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather, and a good example to all of us.\u201d___Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/news/2021/04/prince-philip-is-laid-to-rest-as-somber-queen-elizabeth-ii-sits-alone.html", "date": "2021-04-17161868352154614:18:41"}
