Mencken once said that \u201cEvery election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods.\u201dThat creates quite an opportunity for those who can figure out how the bidding is going.In the past few presidential cycles, no one has done that quite as well as Raghavan Mayur of Bergen County.Mayur, who emigrated from India as a young man and put himself through college, runs the IBD/TIPP poll. That poll has been among the most accurate in predicting the presidential race since 2008. That year Mayur predicted the exact margin by which Barack Obama would beat Republican John McCain: 7.2 percent.In this latest cycle, some major polls had Joe Biden beating Donald Trump by 10 to 12 points. In an election post-mortem, Northeastern University Political science that \u201ctwo of the 14 polls were highly accurate. Both the Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP and The Hill/HarrisX polls had Joe Biden ahead by 4 percentage points\u201d compared to a final margin of 3.8 points.When I called Panagopoulos, who is an expert in the science of polling, he told me it\u2019s not really a science.\u201cIt\u2019s as much of an art as it is a science,\u201d Panagopoulos said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that polls come as close as they often do, given the challenges they face.\u201dThat sentiment was shared by a consortium of five Democratic-leaning polling firms thatTuesday that focused on their mistakes, stating that \u201cin 2020, our industry saw major errors and failed to live up to our own expectations.\u201dIt stated that pollsters assumed they had taken into account the high turnout among certain demographic groups that threw them off in 2016, but \u201cwe again underestimated relative turnout among rural and white non-college voters.\u201dTypical were a couple of races for Senate seats won by Republican incumbents. Polls predicted Sen. Susan Collins of Maine would lose her re-election bid; she won by nine points. Another poor performer in the polls, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, was re-elected in a 10-point landslide.The report concluded that \u201cwe have to realize polling error has been far more pronounced in presidential elections, especially those with Donald Trump on the ballot, so we should be careful not to correct for an error that may be geared to one man who will, hopefully, never be on the ballot again.\u201dWhen I ran that by Mayur, he said the inclusion of the word \u201chopefully\u201d in that passage gives a clue as to where those pollsters went wrong.\u201cIt looks really unsophisticated,\u201d Mayur said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a doctor saying, \u2018I hope I\u2019m not gonna see a bad patient tomorrow.\u2019\u201dPollsters can\u2019t let their personal views enter into their work, Mayur said. That goes for both parties.Back in 2012ssured me that Mitt Romney would easily dispatch Obama. (In fact, Romneythat Trump lost in 2020.) But the polls showed that Obama had an edge in the key swing states, just as Biden had in the 2020 election. That\u2019s what counts these days, said Panagopoulos.\u201cThe national vote is almost irrelevant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is relevant is state-to-state.\u201dAnd that\u2019s become a roll of the dice. In 2016, \u201cThe national polls actually did very well in predicting the margin that Hillary got,\u201d said Panagopoulos. \u201cShe just didn\u2019t get the votes in the right states.\u201dThis time around Trump was on the losing end \u2013 again by a tiny margin. That Democratic polling report noted that \u201cthanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, the difference between a new administration and four more years of Donald Trump was merely 43,000 votes cast across Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona.\u201dTrump\u2019s 2016 win was similar. In that year, Clinton would have wonmore in three key states.That pattern of red states, blue states and swing states is likely to be with us for as long as the Electoral College is. That makes accurate polling even more important for candidates who want to focus their resources wisely.\u201cAt every step you want to be as good as you can be,\u201d Mayur said. \u201cThe quality of interviewers matters. When you have people who are very pleasing, you get better cooperation from people.\u201dThat sort of thing is expensive, he said. But voters get disillusioned when they hear talking heads touting some poll prediction that doesn\u2019t make it through election night.Mayur recently  The results broke along party lines, with 57 percent of Democrats saying they trust polls while 71 of Republicans saying they don\u2019t trust polls.As for me, the only poll I trust is Mayur\u2019s.If I\u2019m going to watch an auction, I want a front-row seat.If you\u2019d like to get around the cancel culture and link to a free-speech site where I post my columns, please go to\u00a0and search for @PmulshineNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/chalk-up-another-win-for-bergen-countys-and-americas-most-accurate-pollster-mulshine.html", "date": "2021-04-15161850010905911:21:49"}
