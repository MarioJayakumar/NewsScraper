Then he authorized These measures were intended to address a budget crisis that wound up being far milder than projected, with state tax collections coming in above expectations. More recently, lawmakers in Washington approved a massive new coronavirus spending package, from which New Jersey is slated to receive  in additional federal funds.Considering all this, it\u2019s hardly surprising Murphy has avoided another tax increase.

Murphy claims he\u2019s being fiscally prudent but that claim falls flat when you consider just how dramatic his tax and spending increases have been.Last year \u2014 in the middle of a pandemic that led to crushing economic damage to businesses and families \u2014 Murphy imposed the tax and fee increases noted above. Plus, he reversed the corporation business tax rate decline, effectively increasing taxes on many state businesses.

The top reasons cited: high taxes, high cost of living, government corruption and crime. These are all problems lawmakers in Trenton could address. Most of them have probably promised to do so. But year after year, those promises are broken, the problems grow more serious, and more residents make the decision to leave.The governor and members of the state legislature have the power to change course. It begins with restraining spending, cutting waste, and seeking new ways to allow taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money. New Jersey is a great place to live, and lots of us want to find a way to stay. We just need our state government to stop seeking new ways to drive us out.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/give-new-jersey-taxpayers-a-reason-to-stay-opinion.html", "date": "2021-04-15161850426028512:31:00"}
