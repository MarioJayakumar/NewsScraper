While the Eagles gained an  in the deal, some analysts and fans scoffed at the decision to move back, because it took them out of the presumed range to select Florida\u2019s  or LSU\u2019s .However, Kiper, ESPN\u2019s top draft analyst, still thinks the Eagles can come away with a top-5 player at No. 12. He rates Alabama wide receivers  as two of the five best players in the class.\u201cI love them both,\u201d Kiper said Thursday. \u201cI think one of those two could drop a little bit because other players get pushed up, and a receiver may drop. It\u2019s possible at 12 that you could see one of those two players.\u201dKiper thinks the elite upside of the Alabama receivers comes from their shared versatility.Smith made plays all over the field last season, winning the Heisman Trophy as a result. Waddle, who is known for his dynamic speed, brings extra value to the special teams unit.\u201cDeVonta, 50% of his catches were in the slot and 50% were outside,\u201d Kiper said. \u201cWaddle is a great punter returner, and an impactful slot guy, who is a coast-to-coast player.\u201dWhile Smith produced 117 catches for 1,856 yards and 23 touchdowns last season, he\u2019s been knocked for his 6-foot-0, 170-pound frame. The ultra-productive receiver might drop in the draft as a result.Waddle is coming off a notable ankle injury, but he impressed Kiper with his toughness, as he came back for the College Football Playoff Championship Game in January.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me if Waddle went before Smith,\u201d Kiper said.While Waddle and Smith have minor question marks, Kiper believes they will shine at the next level. Either receiver could significantly help their former college teammate, Eagles QB , within the Philadelphia offense, this season and beyond.\u201cThey\u2019re both great, and they have both pushed each other,\u201d Kiper said. \u201cThey are both remarkable talents and remarkable workers.\u201d Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/eagles/2021/04/nfl-draft-2021-why-espns-mel-kiper-thinks-eagles-could-still-select-alabamas-jaylen-waddle-or-devonta-smith-in-1st-round.html", "date": "2021-04-16161856900053106:30:00"}
