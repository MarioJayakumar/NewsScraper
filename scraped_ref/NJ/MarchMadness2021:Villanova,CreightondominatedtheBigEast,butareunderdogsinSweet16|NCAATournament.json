{"title": "March Madness 2021: Villanova, Creighton dominated the Big East, but are underdogs in Sweet 16 | NCAA Tournament", "body": "Villanova head coach Jay Wright faces No. 1 Baylor in the Sweet 16 of the 2021 NCAA Tournament.It isn\u2019t often that Villanova coach knows his team is a legitimate underdog.After all, the Wildcats have won two of the last four NCAA championships and have dominated the new Big East since the football schools split off in 2013. During that time, Villanova has won seven Big East regular-season titles, including this year, and four Big East Tournament titles.But now that the Wildcats (18-6), the 5 seed in the South Region, are into the Sweet 16 of the  they will be a decided underdog on Saturday against No. 1 Baylor, the Big 12 regular-season champions (5:15 p.m. ET on CBS).Baylor (24-2) is a 6 1/2-point favorite according to some sites and the Bears are the second favorite behind overall No. 1 seed Gonzaga to win the title. Gonzaga will face the Big East\u2019s other remaining team, Creighton, on Sunday in the West Region (2:10 p.m. ET, CBS).\u201cThe good thing about coaching young people 18 to 22, I don\u2019t really think that they think that they\u2019re underdogs that often but as coaches you definitely know that you are,\u201d Wright joked on Wednesday.He added that it\u2019s sometimes easier to coach a team when it\u2019s perceived as the underdog because there\u2019s less pressure to win.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely less pressure on the coaching staff but I don\u2019t think the players think of themselves as underdogs, which is a good thing,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s something you have to battle when they\u2019re not underdogs.\u201dVillanova continues to play without starting senior point guard Collin Gillespie (knee surgery), who shared Big East Player of the Year honors with teammate Jeremiah Robinson-Earl Without Gillespie, Villanova has had to rely on some younger and less proven players to play key supporting roles, They still have Robinson-Earl, a multifaceted sophomore forward who is likely headed to the NBA, and senior forward Jermaine Samuels playing key leadership roles.\u201cI think Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Jermaine Samuels have really stepped up and taken over the leadership of this team and it\u2019s pretty impressive to watch,\u201d Wright said.Still, the Wildcats will have their hands full with Baylor\u2019s group of veteran guards and wings in Jared Butler, a first-team All-American selection, MaCio Teague, Davion Mitchell, Adam Flagler and wing Matthew Mayer. Baylor crushed Hartford by 24 points and beat Wisconsin by 13.\u201cWe got some young guys going up against some veteran studs,\u201d Wright said. \u201cButler, Teague, Mitchell, Flagler, even Mayer, you can almost count him as a guard. It\u2019s not just their talent, but their basketball IQ is outstanding and that\u2019s what happens when guys stay in college for a few years, they really learn the game.\u201dHe added of Baylor: \u201cThis is a really intelligent team, as well as extremely talented, and we\u2019re going to have young guys going against them but they love that. That\u2019s what the young guys want to do, they want to go up against the best and they want to get their shot.\u201dNo. 5 Creighton (22-8), which finished in second place in the Big East behind Villanova on percentage points, will face the No. 1 Bulldogs (28-0), who are trying to become the first undefeated national champion since Bob Knight\u2019s Indiana team in 1976. Gonzaga beat Norfolk State by 43 points and Oklahoma by 16.\u201cI\u2019m always going to expect to win,\u201d Creighton junior point guard Marcus Zegarowski said after the Bluejays edged UC Santa Barbara, 63-62. \u201cI don\u2019t care who I play. I know they\u2019re a great team. I know they have no weaknesses. I know they haven\u2019t lost, but that doesn\u2019t change my mentality. I\u2019m going in telling my guys, they\u2019ve still got to play us. Obviously, that don\u2019t take nothing away from them. They\u2019re a great team. They dominate teams. We have to have a really good game plan and really execute that.\u201dCreighton is in the program\u2019s first Sweet 16 despite dealing with some adversity and controversy. Coach Greg McDermott made a racially insensitive remark to his players about a \u201cplantation\u201d after the team\u2019s loss to Xavier last month. He apologized and offered to resign but was then allowed to coach the next game against Villanova, which the Bluejays lost. Creighton then gave McDermott a one-game suspension for the regular-season finale against Butler, but allowed McDermott to begin coaching again in the Big East Tournament where they  to  Georgetown team.Zegarowski came out to support McDermott,  after the Butler game, \u201cPeople make mistakes. That\u2019s my guy.\u201dAs for reaching the Sweet 16, Zegarowski said: \u201cThis is a two-year kind of thing for us. We got it taken away from us last year, and everything we\u2019ve been through this year is for moments like this, and I\u2019m happy we capitalized and came through. But you know, we\u2019re not done yet.\u201dEven though they\u2019re both underdogs, the Big East has two teams in the Sweet 16, while the vaunted Big Ten has only one in Michigan after starting with nine teams, including two No. 1 seeds in Michigan and Illinois and two No. 2s in Iowa and Ohio State. The Pac-12 leads the way with four teams remaining in Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA and USC.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of the Big East,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAll of us in the league, we all text each other during the Tournament. We really do take pride in being a basketball league and that all the schools and all the decisions in the league are made about men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball and so we really root for each other and having two teams advance to the second weekend is important for our league and it shows what we believe, we can play with anybody in the country.\u201dNow they get a chance to prove it.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/setonhall/2021/03/march-madness-2021-villanova-creighton-dominated-the-big-east-but-are-underdogs-in-sweet-16-ncaa-tournament.html", "date": "2021-03-25161667540055308:30:00"}
