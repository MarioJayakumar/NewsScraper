{"title": "Gov. Murphy\u2019s Democratic primary opponents should be tossed off ballot, judges say", "body": "It looks like Gov.  will go unchallenged in this year\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary after administrative law judges Tuesday said his two would-be challengers should be tossed off the ballot for failing to get enough voter signatures on their petitions.Judge Jeffrey Rabin ruled one of the challengers, Lisa McCormick, didn\u2019t have a single valid signature from all of the 1,951 she submitted. The state requires a minimum of 1,000 signatures to get on the gubernatorial ballot.The Democratic State Committee charged that McCormick\u2019s campaign used voter data to automatically fill petitions without the voters\u2019 knowledge. There were at least two petitioners who were dead when they allegedly signed their support for McCormick\u2019s campaign, some names were misspelled and others had moved out of the state, Rajiv Parikh, attorney for the Democratic State Committee argued.\u201c\u2026 It appeared to the layman\u2019s eye as if respondent McCormick had, at the last minute, simply created a template for completing individual single signature petition forms and merely inserted the names of addresses of miscellaneous registered Democrats into the forms,\u201d .The final decision is now up to Secretary of State Tahesha Way. Her ruling could also be appealed in state court.Parikh had said Monday he believed there should be a criminal inquiry into McCormick\u2019s petitions.McCormick told NJ Advance Media Tuesday she will \u201cask voters to write in (her) name on June 8.\u201d\u201cI am surprised that they are so afraid of someone who won\u2019t raise money and only is armed only with the truth,\u201d she said.In a statement from Monday, McCormick said her campaign manager, Jim Devine, \u201chandled petitions for me and I am confident that he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201dNeither McCormick nor Devine attended the Monday virtual hearing.McCormick has run failed campaigns to get on a city council or become a county clerk. She also lost a Democratic primary against U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. Her best showing in a political race was when she took nearly 4 out of 10 votes in the 2018 primary race against U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, in the wake of his  and a criminal corruption trial that ended in a  before the charges Murphy\u2019s other potential challenger was Roger Bacon.In Bacon\u2019s case, Administrative Law Judge JoAnn Candido  because about 280 he gathered were from registered Republicans \u2014 which is invalid for a Democratic primary. About two dozen other petitions were tossed out for other reasons.Bacon had submitted 1,271 signatures to the state. He was trying to run under the \u201cMake New Jersey Great Again\u201d slogan. Bacon has been a candidate in multiple failed races in the state, including running for Congress as a Libertarian in the early 1990s and placing fourth in a Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2009 when three people tried to challenge former Gov. Jon Corzine.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/04/gov-murphys-democratic-primary-opponents-should-be-tossed-off-ballot-judge-says.html", "date": "2021-04-13161835420683318:50:06"}
