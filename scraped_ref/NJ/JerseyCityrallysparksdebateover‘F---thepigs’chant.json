{"title": "Jersey City rally sparks debate over \u2018F--- the pigs\u2019 chant", "body": "A Saturday rally in Jersey City sparked debate after video circulated online of marchers shouting \u201cF--- the pigs,\u201d apparently at police officers stationed on the street.A video clip of roughly 100 protestors shouting the slogan as they approach a Jersey City Police Department vehicle drew criticism from Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who called the chant \u201cinflammatory + infectious rhetoric which only further divides us\u201d on Twitter.\u201cObscenities being hurled at police officers who risk their lives every day is unacceptable, we should agree this isn\u2019t an appropriate way to express grievances + it undermines calls for change,\u201d he wrote.1/2 About this demonstration yesterday in JC w/repeated chants of \u201cFuck the Pigs\u201d...  I\u2019ll be the 1st to say that Civil Demonstrations, criticism,  & protests are welcome here in , our nation's history has proven it\u2019s produced changes in govt. BUT What we can\u2019t... But Fulop\u2019s condemnation sparked its own wave of criticism, with dozens weighing in on social media to call his comments tone-deaf and misplaced.\u201cThat you choose to take to Twitter to chastise this extremely mild protest (shouting? Gasp!) instead of the daily horrors that police inflict on black Americans is an embarrassment,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\u201cIt\u2019s the consistency in the mayor not valuing or respecting our grievances, but immediately ready to tone-police us and censor our speech and tell us how exactly we\u2019re supposed to protest,\u201d said Nevin Perkins, the founder of activist group Black Men United and organizer of the protest that started as a \u201cBlack Power Rally\u201d at Berry Lane Park.Saturday\u2019s protest came in the wake of a series of police killings across the country and two days before final arguments in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges for the death of George Floyd last May.Cities around the country are bracing for unrest in the wake of a verdict. Jersey City spokeswoman Kim Wallace-Scalcione did not say whether or not the police department is making preparations for protests in Jersey City, but said that the city \u201cis always willing to work with organizers to ensure the safety and protection of all participants, police officers, and the entire community.\u201dPerkins said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t speak on\u201d any planned actions in response to a verdict, but said Saturday\u2019s event was not related to specific incidents.The online debate over the protest highlights an enduring disconnect between both city hall and the JCPD and members of the Black community, some of whom see the mayor as too far removed from the realities of life on the city\u2019s south side.Pamela Johnson, an activist and the executive director of the Jersey City Anti Violence Coalition Movement, said in a text message that Saturday\u2019s action \u201csays that there\u2019s a lot more work to do as it related to community-police relations\u201d and called on the city to create a dialogue with protest organizers.\u201cAll across this country there has been real change to bridge that gap and we clearly have to do more,\u201d she said.Asked about relations between the community and the JCPD, Wallace-Scalcione cited a number of measures taken by the administration, including body camera mandates, public meetings, and the appointment of Police Director Tawana Moody, a civilian, to oversee the department.\u201cThis administration has always welcomed \u2014 and has even participated in \u2014 public demonstrations that support civil rights and progress,\u201d Wallace-Scalcione said. \u201cBut the obscenity-filled verbal assault on the very police officers that protect these people and their families was clearly not intended to be anything remotely productive.\u201dCarmine Disbrow, the president of the Jersey City Police Officers Benevolent Association, called the chant \u201chateful\u201d and said the protestors \u201cdo not represent that vast majority of Jersey City residents who appreciate the work our police officers do to keep the city safe.\u201dPerkins said he has no desire to build trust with the city administration or the JCPD. Black Men United is focused on organizing within Black communities, he said; to that end, the group hosts regular food and clothing donations and organizes neighborhood cleanups.\u201cWe\u2019re a group that has abolitionist principles,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cSo we\u2019re actually calling for the abolishment of all law enforcement as we understand it in our society today.\u201dAsked if he wanted to see any reforms in the JCPD, Perkins said only that police should \u201cstay out the way.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2021/04/jersey-city-rally-sparks-debate-over-f-the-pigs-chant.html", "date": "2021-04-19161887268440418:51:24"}
