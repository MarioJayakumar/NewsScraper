Get to know Jack and Michael.They\u2019re the two most-common first names of the 224 wrestlers competing next weekend at the NJSIAA State Championships. There are eight Jacks and eight more Michaels.There\u2019s Jack Maida from Shore Regional, Mount Olive\u2019s Jack Bastarrika and Jack Zaleski from Middletown South, to name a few. Then there\u2019s Austin Jack from Jefferson and Camden Catholic\u2019s Jackson Young. They don\u2019t count as one of the eight Jacks, and for that matter, neither does Brett Blaess of Jackson Memorial.But before we get too confused, let\u2019s take a look back and understand how we got sidetracked by Simple Jack.This all started as a deep dive to answer a simple question: Who were the top teams at the NJSIAA\u2019s regional tournaments this past weekend?We tallied up the total number of state qualifiers and crunched the data to provide a breakdown of the top teams, best-performing regions and ultimately determine how the state\u2019s competitive balance played out over two busy days of wrestling at four different sites.Our findings are below. You can find the rest of the Jacks, Michaels and other state qualifiers .To understand the chart, here\u2019s an explainer on this season\u2019s postseason process. In a normal year, there are eight regional tournaments that serve as a qualifier for the state tournament. This year, the NJSIAA condensed the eight regions into four super regions to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. The end result were four stacked tournaments with about 80 teams in each.Teams from Regions 1 and 2 competed at the North 1 Tournament in Mount Olive; Regions 3 and 4 went to Union as part of the North 2 Tournament; the Central Tournament at Hunterdon Central drew teams from Regions 5 and 6 and the South Tournament at Cherry Hill East consisted of teams from Regions 7 and 8.Below was the total number of state qualifiers from each traditional region. The top four finishers in each of the 14 weight classes at each of the four super regions qualified.All 11 wrestlers from Delbarton, who entered, advanced to the state tournament, giving the Green Wave the highest total. Delbarton, which has been ranked No. 1 in the NJ.com Top 20 since the end of last season, had two more than No. 4 Bergen Catholic and three more than No. 2 Kingsway and No. 3 St. Joseph (Mont.).You can find the the 23 teams with three or more qualifiers below.Not all state qualifiers are equal \u2014 some were region champs others finished fourth. Below is a placement breakdown for each of the 125 teams who had at least one wrestler advance.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2021/04/which-wrestling-teams-dominated-at-regions-heres-a-wide-ranging-look-by-the-numbers.html?fbclid=IwAR081LEwDRoe9gsZHNJr82jWIOMVEUDRnH7OzJuPZbbC1PfUcVx-RBE0fRE", "date": "2021-04-19161885511073617:58:30"}
