{"title": "Eli Manning didn\u2019t enjoy going \u2018cold turkey\u2019 in retirement, so now he\u2019ll return to Giants (in more ways than one)", "body": "Former Giants quarterback Eli Manning could return to the organization in some capacity in 2021. last January in a lavish ceremony at the \u2019 indoor practice facility, and that might\u2019ve been the last time he stepped foot on campus for an entire year.He wasn\u2019t welcome at MetLife Stadium last year, but neither were any of the fans. There was no easing Manning into retirement. He left the podium and landed on his couch. Manning couldn\u2019t watch practice, visit old friends at the team facility or watch Giants games as a member of the fan base that supported him for nearly 20 years.Manning might\u2019ve had his No. 10 retired last season, but the pandemic had other plans. Maybe that\u2019ll happen in 2021 instead, with (some) fans expected to return.\u201cI\u2019m so used to seeing everybody there for 16 straight years,\u201d Manning told NJ Advance Media , \u201cand then you go cold turkey.\u201dAs Manning enters his second year of retirement, hopefully post-pandemic \u2014 or something like it \u2014 it will be a jam-packed year for him. It includes his own TV show: on . It\u2019s a sequel to his brother\u2019s show \u201cPeyton\u2019s Places\u201d, only this Manning has been touring college campuses and learning college football history. One episode he learns about the first-ever college football game, which was played at  against Princeton in 1869.Manning will also make his return to the Giants organization after a year away. What exactly his role will entail is unclear right now.\u201cWe\u2019re figuring that out,\u201d Manning said of his new role. \u201cThe Giants have been so important to me and the last 16 years of my life and really my whole adulthood. We\u2019re going to be living in the same area so just wanted to see if there\u2019s a role there to stay involved in some way. We\u2019re still discussing that, figuring that out, but just hope that we can find something, find ways for me to be involved and figure out how that\u2019s going to work out.\u201dHe\u2019s kept in contact with Giants quarterback  he said, though they haven\u2019t spoken much since meeting up after the season and expects they\u2019ll chat again as the season draws closer.Manning\u2019s role is more likely to be an ambassador role than that of a coach or front office consultant, though he does have some coaching experience over the last year, helping out with his son and daughters\u2019 teams.As a coach, Manning says he\u2019s not quite  or \u201cI think I\u2019m fair. Tough but fair,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m not making them run laps. I don\u2019t require them to be five minutes early yet. But I appreciate the hard work and want them to work hard ... It\u2019s really just about being with my kids and seeing them interact with other kids, how they take the coaching and how they take the great life lessons you learn from sports.\u201dIf Manning does wind up in an ambassador role for the Giants, it\u2019ll likely look something like what he did representing the team on Tuesday. , surprising the parents of Penelope Lindsay, a 2 1/2-year-old that passed away in February after a battle with neuroblastoma.Manning was one of the NFL\u2019s most charitable players in his playing days, and that won\u2019t end in retirement.Maybe he\u2019ll finally make his return to MetLife in 2021, too.\u201cIt was weird not being able to go see a game or even being around the facility and seeing the team or the personnel and staff around the Giants organization for a year,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m looking forward to getting back.\u201dNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.", "url": "https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/04/eli-manning-didnt-enjoy-going-cold-turkey-in-retirement-so-now-hell-return-to-giants-in-more-ways-than-one.html", "date": "2021-04-14161839890038707:15:00"}
