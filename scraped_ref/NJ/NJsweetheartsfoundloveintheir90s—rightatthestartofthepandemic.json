April 15, 2021This is a story on how it is never too late to find love, and how even the worst of times can serve as the catalyst.Bill Biega is 98. Iris Ivers is 91.Their longtime friendship was blossoming into romance by March 2020. That\u2019s when the pandemic prompted a stay-at-home order at the Applewood continuing care retirement community in Freehold, where they resided in separate apartments.Bill and Iris quickly realized they couldn\u2019t stay apart, resulting in an awkward encounter more befitting a college dorm.\u201cA security guard caught me sneaking back into my apartment,\u201d explained Bill Biega, who will turn 99 in July.The guard told him that everyone on the floor knew what was going on and gave the furtive couple a choice: Move in together, or stay apart indefinitely.Iris packed up her belongings and joined Bill in his apartment the next day.Just over a year later, both are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The stay-at-home order has been lifted but Bill and Iris are still living together, a choice prompted by a pandemic that neither could have imagined. A ray of light, amid so much loss.Iris described Bill\u2019s one-bedroom apartment as \u201ccozy for two.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t imagine us not being together, as long as we can be. We\u2019re also realistic, and we know that we\u2019re not getting any younger,\u201d Iris said.Iris moved to Applewood in 2019, eighteen years after her husband died. Bill arrived a few months later after experiencing the same heartbreak.\u201cMy wife passed away one month after our 75th anniversary. I spent 75 years happily married. Now I\u2019m spending the last years of my life happily with Iris,\u201d Bill said.Bill Biega, 98, and Iris Ivers, 91, both widowed, found love during the pandemic and moved in together.\nFreehold,N.J. April 15, 2021For all they have in common \u2014 they met years ago while playing bridge in a residential community for those 55 and older \u2014 Bill and Iris came from two very different places.Bill is a native of Poland and describes himself as among the last survivors of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, in which resistance fighters attempted to drive out the Nazis. He spent some time in England, and notes the enduring trace of an English accent in his voice. He had a career as an engineer and global sales executive after moving to the United States.\u201cI consider myself an extremely fortunate man,\u201d Bill said.Iris grew up in Schenectady, New York, not far from Albany. She graduated from Cornell University and moved with her husband and young son to New York City, where she enjoyed taking him to Washington Square Park. There, she met a woman whose husband worked for Sports Illustrated, then a relatively new magazine. The chance encounter led to a 25-year career, culminating in her becoming deputy copy chief editor.\u201cIt was one of those wonderful flukes,\u201d Iris said.She retired in 1984 to care for her husband after he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease.Iris met Bill, and his wife, when she moved to Concordia, an age-restricted community in Monroe, after her husband died.\u201cWe were both bridge players, and we wound up being partners,\u201d she said.It was not uncommon, she explained, for residents to move from Concordia to Applewood as they got older, including a couple she knew from the bridge games.Applewood opened in 1990 on 40 acres in Freehold and is home to 300 seniors.\u201cWhen the time came for me to think of moving, they encouraged me to come. Then, some months later, Bill\u2019s wife passed away,\u201d she said.Bill settled into his new home at Applewood. He and Iris reconnected and unexpectedly discovered a deeper bond. He introduced her to swimming.\u201cWe are both very fortunate, in that we are basically well,\u201d Bill said.Then came the onset of the pandemic \u2014 a terrifying time for seniors, especially those living in close quarters.Applewood implemented numerous protocols aimed at keeping everyone safe, including the stay-at-home directive. Iris said even a simple walk down the hallway was prohibited.\u201cThe rules were very strict,\u201d she said.She and Bill tried to comply. They spent a lot of time talking on the telephone. It wasn\u2019t enough.That\u2019s when Bill got snagged by the security guard.\u201cManagement was very, very careful about protecting everybody,\u201d he said.Bill Biega, 98, and Iris Ivers, 91, both widowed, found love during the pandemic and moved in together.\nFreehold,N.J. April 15, 2021Their impulsive decision to move in together has turned out perfectly. Iris still has her apartment, mostly because it is full of the artwork created by her late husband.She and Bill have a glass of wine with dinner every night.\u201cBill orders it by the case. He\u2019s a bit of a gourmet and he knows he wine. I just go along for the ride,\u201d Iris said.Iris said she is a \u201csuper-news junkie\u201d and Bill, though he also follows the news, is more of a history buff.\u201cPolitically, we\u2019re kind of in the same basket. I\u2019m a little to the left of Bill, but I\u2019ve been pulling him my way,\u201d Iris said with a laugh.Now that they are both vaccinated, they are looking forward to getting out and exploring, vividly aware that every day is precious \u2014 especially for a couple in their 90s.\u201cI feel so fortunate that I\u2019m still living here and still surviving, and have the love and care of Iris,\u201d Bill said.Iris said she and Bill \u201ckind of live it day by day.\u201d\u201cListen, they\u2019re not all good days. Some days, he doesn\u2019t feel well. Some days, I don\u2019t feel well. We just get through it,\u201d said Iris.She explained their bond by discussing their shared perspective on what really matters.\u201cOur philosophies of life are sort of similar,\u201d she said.\u201cMoney does not make you happy. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve really learned. It\u2019s the people you meet and the relationships that you maintain. That\u2019s what we value,\u201d she said.
