{"title": "Biden\u2019s broken promise. And why he has no choice. | Editorial", "body": "President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting with lawmakers to discuss his infrastructure plan in Washington. (Patrick Semansky | AP)During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised to work \u201cacross the aisle to reach consensus\u201d with Republicans in Congress. But so far, we\u2019ve seen no evidence of that, beyond a few bipartisan meetings at the White House that produced no agreement.So, now Biden is redefining the word \u201cbipartisan.\u201d It\u2019s no longer about making deals with Mitch McConnell, but going over his head, and fashioning policies that appeal to Republican voters themselves.\u201cIf you looked up \u2018bipartisan\u2019 in the dictionary, I think it would say support from Republicans and Democrats,\u201d his senior advisor, Anita Dunn, recently told the Washington Post. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say the Republicans have to be in Congress.\u201dYes, we are witnessing a bait and switch. During the campaign, Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals called him a dreamer when he said he could make deals with Republicans in Washington. And let\u2019s face it, his critics were correct.But if you dig a little deeper, you can see whyhe has little choice. Republicans are playing the same game they played with President Obama \u2013 opposing everything, and rooting for Biden\u2019s failure. Not a single Republican voted for the immensely popular $1.9 trillion recovery plan, and now GOP leaders are taking the same hard line on the infrastructure bill.So what exactly is Biden supposed to do, scale back his ambitions to meet the approval of McConnell and his crew \u2013 even when the public is demanding action, and even when Republican voters express substantial support for acting boldly? In one survey on the rescue plan, 77% said \u201cgetting Americans the help they need\u201d was more important to them than \u201cpassing a bipartisan package.\u201dBiden saw what happened to President Obama, who scaled back his ambitions to win GOP support, and got nothing but a slap in the face in return. During the Great Recession, he scaled back his stimulus plan, and still got no Republican votes. When he designed the Affordable Care Act, he modeled it on a plan enacted by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, and declined to include a \u201cpublic option\u201d that would have allowed government plans to compete directly with private insurers. Again, he got nothing but the hand.And who could forget what Republicans did to Merrick Garland? McConnell refused to give his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court a floor vote, even though it, too, had bipartisan support. The Senate Republican leader\u2019s justification for this, that justices shouldn\u2019t be seated in an election year, lasted right up until the moment he heard Ruth Bader Ginsberg had died.So yes, Biden did promise to partner with Republicans, but he can\u2019t do that if their leaders in Washington are obstinate, even when their own people are with Biden on core issues.Republicans in state and local offices are more practical, and are offering Biden support on the infrastructure plan. Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Ariz, called it \u201ca very good thing\u201d for his city. He ticked off the benefits to the New York Times: Finally upgrading an airport tower, widening roads, expanding broadband Internet and a regional light rail.Giles said he felt let down by the Republican opposition in Congress. \u201cIt was only a few months ago that we all agreed that infrastructure was a bipartisan issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat attitude shouldn\u2019t shift just because there\u2019s a new administration in the White House.\u201dGun safety offers another glaring example. A  showed that 84 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including 77 percent of Republicans, and still Republican leaders in Congress resist. Should Biden, in the name of bipartisanship, reject the overwhelming desire of Americans to take at least some modest steps to reduce the mass shootings?No, Biden should not restrict himself to the cramped ambitions of McConnell, giving veto power to a man who has acted in bad faith, over and over. This president is determined to get things done, and if that means doing it without GOP support, then so be it.Biden has vowed to be the \u201cpresident for all Americans.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. McConnell and his Republican colleagues are the ones standing in the way, and freezing this partisan standoff in place.
