Hall was in Baltimore this week, filming an upcoming episode of her show in and around the city. \"Baltimore is beautiful, it is an iconic American city. When you think about it, our studio is based in New York and a lot of people will start to take their first trips and it's likely someplace near home where you're comfortable driving with kids or with friends, and so we thought to ourselves, what more outside city can you pick?\" Hall said. \"I'm throwing out the first pitch at the Orioles game, and we're just enjoying the beauty of Baltimore. That's the great thing about this city, you don't have to have a long to-do list. You really can just walk around and sightsee and in every turn there's something that marks history or just good people or great restaurants,\" she added. You can watch The Tamron Hall Show on WBAL-TV 11 weekdays at 3 p.m.\n\t\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.wbaltv.com/article/tamron-hall-visits-baltimore-to-film-upcoming-episode-of-show/36369079", "date": "\n\t\t\t\t\tUpdated: 6:16 PM EDT May 7, 2021\n\t\t\t\t", "access_date": "2021-05-07T19:55:03.481298"}
