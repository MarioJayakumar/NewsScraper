The vandals were dressed in all black and ran away as the victim called police, the release said. There was more than $400 worth of damage to the home, so police said the incident is considered felony vandalism. Police said the home was the previous residence of Brodd, though he \"has not lived at the residence for a number of years and is no longer a resident of California,\" the release said. \"It appears the suspects in this vandalism were targeting Mr. Brodd for his testimony,\" police said in the release. \"Because Mr. Brodd no longer lives in the city of Santa Rosa, it appears the victim was falsely targeted.\"Another act of vandalism took place 45 minutes later at Santa Rosa Plaza Mall, where a large hand statue was also smeared in pig's blood. The vandals also left a sign in front of the statue with a picture of a pig that read \"Oink Oink,\" the release said. Police believe both the home and hand statue were vandalized by the same people.
