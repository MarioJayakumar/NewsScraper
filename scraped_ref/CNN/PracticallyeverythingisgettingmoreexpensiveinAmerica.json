They were lifted in particular by surging energy prices, including the cost of gasoline \u2014 which jumped 22.5% over the last 12 months ending in March.  and didn't get  until the start of 2021.In March alone, consumer prices climbed 0.6%. That was more than expected, as well as the largest increase since August 2012.Excluding volatile energy costs as well as food prices, which increased only 0.1% last month, America's consumer prices still rose 1.6% from the previous year, data from the  revealed. That was more than economists surveyed by Refinitiv had predicted.Prices for used cars and trucks \u2014 which got a  during the second half of last year as people across the country bought vehicles in response to travel restrictions \u2014 rose 0.5% in March, marking their first monthly increase since October.

But prices increases will moderate in the second half of the year as historical comparisons will be more favorable, said Action Economics' chief economist Mike Englund.\"In our estimation it would be a mistake for policymakers, investors and firm managers to conclude that there is about to be a sustained and significant breakout higher in the overall level of prices that results in diminished consumer purchasing power and thinner profit margins over the medium to long term,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, in a note to clients.The Fed has repeatedly said that inflation would need to run above its target of around 2% for a while, and that other factors, including a recovery of the labor market, were also key to changes in monetary policy.
