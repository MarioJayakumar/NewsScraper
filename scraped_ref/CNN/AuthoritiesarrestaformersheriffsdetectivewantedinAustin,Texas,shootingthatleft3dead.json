Our officers went out there and conducted a high-risk stop on him,\" Chief Ryan Phipps told CNN. \"He complied fully with the officers and was taken into custody and they did locate a pistol on his waistband.\"Broderick was transported by the sheriff's office to the Travis County Jail, Phipps said. He has been charged with capital murder and a second-degree felony, according to information on the jail's inmate website. Travis County District Attorney Jos\u00e9 Garza said earlier he wanted Broderick held without bail. Texas law permits his detention without bail because he was already out on bail on other charges, Garza said.The motive in the shooting is unknown. Broderick is a former Travis County Sheriff's Office detective who resigned from the department last year after he was charged in a child sexual assault case, Travis County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Kristen Dark told CNN.He was arrested June 6, 2020 and released on bail the same month.It is unclear whether Broderick has an attorney for his murder case.
