The address would mark Biden's first remarks to both chambers as President, and would come as his administration continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and to pitch lawmakers on his massive infrastructure proposal. Pelosi, a California Democrat, had said earlier this month that she was waiting to make a decision on extending an invitation to Biden amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, noting that it would come in consultation with the Capitol attending physician. President Donald Trump's was delivered just before the pandemic took hold in the US, and his first address to a joint session of Congress was given in late February 2017. Barack Obama, meanwhile, gave his first presidential address to a joint session in February 2009.
