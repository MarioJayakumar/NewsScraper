{"title": "Lizzo has heard from Chris Evans about her drunken DMs", "body": "\"Don't drink and DM,\" the \"Truth Hurts\" singer  on Saturday, revealing she had sent the \"Avengers\" star a drunken message on Instagram after one too many. In the video, Lizzo lip-syncs to a TikTok audio by Tatayanna Mitchell in front of her one-sided convo with Evans.According to the screengrab she shared, Lizzo slid into Evans' inbox at 5:22 p.m., with three simple emojis:  a puff of wind, a sports player and a basketball, presumably to convey the idea of shooting your shot.  \"Don't drink and DM, kids.... for legal porpoises this is a joke,\" she wrote alongside the TikTok video. The following day, the 32-year-old singer updated fans with the latest development in the DM saga, letting them know that Evans had indeed responded. In, Lizzo cannot contain her delight.  \"No shame in a drunk DM [face-blowing-a-kiss emoji] god knows I've done worse on this app lol [facepalm emoji],\" Evans said in his message to the rapper-singer-flutist. \"B*TCH,\" Lizzo simply captioned it.  Lizzo previously went public with her feelings for Evans back in 2019, after he re-shared a video of a young girl dancing to Lizzo's hit song \"Juice,\" writing, \"This kid is cooler than I could ever hope to be.\"  She responded at the time with a follow-up tweet, writing to Evans, \"Wow marry me\" with a shrug face emoji.
