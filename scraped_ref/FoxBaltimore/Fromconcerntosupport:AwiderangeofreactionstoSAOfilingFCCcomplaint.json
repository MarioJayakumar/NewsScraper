She called for the Inspector General to investigate and she didn\u2019t like the results of the investigation so she called foul and claimed they were biased.\u201dVignarajah ran against Mosby in a primary election for City State\u2019s Attorney.\u201cIts also part of a broader troubling trendline where politicians attack the media, attack the coverage when they don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Vignarajah. \u201cCatherine Pugh called the investigation, the coverage a witch-hunt, Donald Trump called the coverage and the investigations a witch-hunt, and now Marilyn Mosby is calling the investigation and the media coverage a witch-hunt.\u201dA Professor of Communication at Loyola University of Maryland also sharing his professional perspective.\u201cEvery politician that\u2019s ever held office is upset with the news coverage that they get,\u201d said Professor Elliot King. \u201cThey never feel its fair. They never feel they\u2019re adequately represented.\u201dOn social media, opinions and perspectives can be seen and heard from all sides.Some on Facebook and Twitter say they are concerned to see a public official potentially attempting to silence a media outlet, while others say they dislike the coverage they see from WBFF-TV.\u201cFox45 is obsessed with finding dirt on the Mosby family,\u201d said one Twitter user.Some Baltimore media outlets are also covering aspects of this story, including WBAL News Radio, the Baltimore Sun, and WMAR-TV.", "url": "https://www.foxbaltimore.com/news/local/from-concern-to-support-a-wide-range-of-reactions-to-sao-filing-fcc-complaint", "date": "2021-05-07T22:05:23.000Z", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:04:37.032377"}
