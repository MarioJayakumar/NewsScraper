{"title": "Jovani Patterson - Full Interview", "body": "BALTIMORE (WBFF) \u2013 Voters in Baltimore City are poised to elect a new city council president with the current leader, Brandon Scott, campaigning to be the next mayor.Current state Del. Nick Mosby, married to Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, is the Democratic nominee for city council president. Mosby is running against Republican candidate Jovani PattersonMosby served on the city council from 2011 to 2016, before serving in the legislature.Requests for an interview with Mosby to talk about his campaign and plans went ignored. According to his website, Mosby\u2019s priorities are health care, improving employment, boosting the education system and increasing safety on Baltimore\u2019s streets. The details are sparse; during a previous interview with Fox 45, Mosby said he supports restructuring when it comes to policing in the city.\u201cThe strategy is not defunding the police, it\u2019s just that defunding the amount of money that\u2019s going to law enforcement could be appropriated in other areas to ensure that we are sustainably reducing crime,\u201d he said.Mosby\u2019s marriage to the city\u2019s top prosecutor did raise some questions about potential conflicts of interest. In a previous interview, Mosby pledged to Fox 45 that he would recuse himself from any potential conflicts.\u201cThat\u2019s the standard approach,\u201d he said.Patterson is running as the Republican candidate. He said the city\u2019s lengthy problems come down to reducing property taxes.\u201cIf we are really serious about bringing economic change, reducing the blighted neighborhoods, reducing the abandoned homes, increasing the number of job opportunities in their city, we have to address the oppressive tax rate in the city,\u201d Patterson said.Patterson said he wants to keep the lights on in city parks to help reduce potential crime and give younger Baltimore City residents stay busy. Patterson also said he wants to reinvest in educational programs, as well as the arts.The GOP candidate said current leadership, largely democratic leadership, does not have the people\u2019s best interest in minds when setting priorities.\u201cThey say they do just in front of the news cameras, but when it comes to actual legislation, it\u2019s all about zoning changes, or name changes or anything like that,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cAny legislation to attract families or attract businesses, it gets pushed, withdrawn or not even put on the table.\u201d", "url": "https://www.foxbaltimore.com/news/raw-news/jovani-patterson-full-interview", "date": "2020-10-16T21:42:53.000Z", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:05:49.120604"}
