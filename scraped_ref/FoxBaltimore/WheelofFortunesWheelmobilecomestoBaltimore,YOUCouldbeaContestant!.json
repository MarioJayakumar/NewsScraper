Just before show time, we will put all the applications in a big golden drum that sits on the stage.When the show begins, our Wheelmobile host will pick applications at random from the drum and call participants up to the stage (in groups of five) to play the game.On stage, we will do a brief interview with each contestant and play a version of the Wheel of Fortune Speed-Up Round.Each person who comes up to the stage will be evaluated as a potential contestant for the show.
