Gardell first became a household name for his breakout role on \u201cMike & Molly\u201d with Melissa McCarthy and now is back with another hit in \u201cBob Hearts Abishola.\u201dThe series about Gardell\u2019s character, Bob Wheeler, having a heart attack and falling in love with his nurse Abishola Adebambo is now in its second season and it was recently picked up for another season. CBS Local\u2019s DJ SIxsmith chatted with Gardell about why this show resonates with people across the country, the magic touch of executive producer Chuck Lorre, and being on another hit CBS show.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I ended up on a second sitcom that is successful,\u201d said Gardell. \u201cUsually you get one and you try and do it again and by episode four everybody goes nah. Folake Olowofoyeku, who plays Abishola, has been just wonderful. Gina Yashere who created our show is a wonderful stand-up comic. She is Nigerian, but lived in England for a long time. She brings an authenticity to our show through her writing and her acting. We just have this nice, eclectic group that is really kind to each other. When you have that, you have a real good shot. The show itself says a really sweet thing. If you\u2019re lucky enough to find someone you fall for and they fall back for you, size, shape and color doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dPut on your finest suit\u2014 a shiny new episode of  starts now! \u2014 Bob \u2764\ufe0f Abishola (@BobAbisholaCBS) Gardell believes his show has been successful because it says something sweet in a really hard time right now. The actor and comedian has also enjoyed learning about the Nigerian culture and eating all of the spicy food.\u201cThe thing that I love about Bob is that his heart and mind are always open,\u201d said Gardell. \u201cHe\u2019ll try anything and that leads to good comedy. Bob also has the American vibe of we don\u2019t need to work all seven days. We can cut school once in a while. I think Bob and Abishola give each other that, but they are also common in their drive for success. As we learn about each other, we find the common threads and we hopefully learn from the differences.\u201dWatch \u201c\u201d Monday nights at 8:30pm EST/PST and stream the whole series on Paramount+.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/04/billy-gardell-interview-bob-hearts-abishola/", "date": "May 4, 2021 at 12:15 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:27:42.527866"}
