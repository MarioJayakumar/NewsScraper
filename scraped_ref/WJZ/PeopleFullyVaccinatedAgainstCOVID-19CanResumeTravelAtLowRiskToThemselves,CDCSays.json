{"title": "People Fully Vaccinated Against COVID-19 Can Resume Travel At Low Risk To Themselves, CDC Says", "body": " The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released a highly anticipated update to travel guidance for people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, eliminating some testing and quarantine recommendations.The CDC says that fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk to themselves.The agency said that as long as coronavirus precautions are taken, including mask wearing, fully vaccinated people can travel within the United States without getting tested for Covid-19 before or self-quarantining after.Maryland  that people should avoid out-of-state travel to areas with a high number or covid-19 cases, particularly the New York metro region, where coronavirus variants are more rampant. He also urged people to get tested when they return from out-of-state travel.For international travel, fully vaccinated people don\u2019t need a Covid-19 test prior to travel \u2014 unless it is required by the destination \u2014 and do not need to self-quarantine after returning to the United States. They should still have a negative Covid-19 test before boarding a flight to the US, and a follow up test three to five days after their return, the CDC noted.The CDC considers someone fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The updated guidance does not apply to unvaccinated people. The CDC advises anyone who hasn\u2019t been fully vaccinated to continue to avoid travel.Unvaccinated people who must travel should get tested one to three days before travel and again three to five days after travel. They should self-quarantine at home for seven days after travel, or 10 days, if they do not get tested post-travel.The CDC said all Americans, regardless of vaccination status, should wear a mask and practice public health measures when traveling, such as physical distancing and washing hands frequently.Last month, the CDC released its first iteration of guidance for fully vaccinated Americans, in which the agency said they should avoid travel. Some critics at the time said the CDC\u2019s stance on travel for fully vaccinated people was too rigid.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky defended the agency\u2019s initial travel guidance last month, explaining that changes to guidance would be ongoing as more people are vaccinated in the US and that scientific data would inform any recommendations.\u201cWe are very worried about transmissible variants. A lot of them have come through our travel corridors, so we\u2019re being extra cautious right now with travel,\u201d Walensky told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in March. She noted that every time travel picks up, a surge in coronavirus cases follows, citing Independence Day, Labor Day and the holiday season.Experts say that the US appears to be entering into another fresh surge this spring, which is partially due to more travel. The US averaged 63,974 daily cases over the last 7-days, up 11% since last week.Many travelers made their way through BWI Airport on Friday for the holiday weekend.\u201cJust come here and spend some time with family,\u201d Joseph Armand said.\u201cHere to see my family,\u201d Margot Kohlar said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a minute and I\u2019m really excited.\u201dTravelers like Debbie Grimm say the safety protocols in place at airports and on planes have helped put her at ease. She\u2019s looking forward to reaching the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201cI just would love to see everybody travel freely again,\u201d Grimm said.The-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
