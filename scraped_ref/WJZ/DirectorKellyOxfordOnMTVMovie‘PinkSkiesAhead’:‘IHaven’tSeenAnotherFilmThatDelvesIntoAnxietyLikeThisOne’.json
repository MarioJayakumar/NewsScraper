Oxford is a first time director and she\u2019s also a New York Times bestseller for her book \u201cEverything Is Perfect When You\u2019re A Liar.\u201dCBS Local\u2019s DJ Sixsmith talked with Oxford about her movie, what it was like to work with Mary J. Blige, Henry Winkler and Marcia Gay Harden and why mental health is such an important topic to destigmatize.\u201cIt was a bit of a long time coming because I wrote this as an essay in my second book,\u201d said Oxford. \u201cI already know this has helped people and I thought I should put it on screen for more people to see. Right now, there are so many kids struggling after this year. Children have had it absolutely the worst this year. No socializing, no school and then parents have had to deal with that. It\u2019s almost catastrophic. When your kids are struggling, you can\u2019t be happy at all.\u201dGet ready for the commercial-free premiere of  TOMORROW at 9p \u2014 it\u2019s all part of the  Premiere-A-Thon on MTV. \ud83d\udc95 \u2014 MTV (@MTV) The coming of age film is set in Los Angeles during the late 1990s and tells the story of a young woman named Winona, who drops out of college and moves back in with her parents. She is diagnosed with anxiety disorder and is skeptical because she hasn\u2019t had a panic attack, but as the movie demonstrates anxiety takes on many different forms.\u201cI really think we need to talk about it [mental health] more,\u201d said Oxford. \u201cI worry the most about people who do have mental conditions and feel a sense of shame or a sense of judgment around it because those things are real. People do still judge people for having a mental condition. It is something that is uncontrollable like getting cancer, but it isn\u2019t treated the same way. I haven\u2019t seen another movie that delves into mental health and anxiety like this one does. My hope is people see it and feel more comfortable in their own skins.\u201dThe movie features several big names like Harden, Mary J. Blige and Henry Winkler. It was a dream come true for Oxford to work with such gifted big names actors.\u201cI\u2019m a first time director, so literally every second on set was like magic to me,\u201d said Oxford. \u201cOur crew was so amazing. It was a very tight knit, small group because it was a small film. People came to me during the shooting and I set I have anxiety and that\u2019s why I took this job. That\u2019s where I was on set and\u00a0 I wanted to make sure I was fostering a really good environment.\u201dWatch \u201cPink Skies Ahead\u201d on MTV Saturday, May 8 at 9pm EST/PST.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/07/pink-skies-ahead-kelly-oxford-interview/", "date": "May 7, 2021 at 2:58 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:30:01.709768"}
