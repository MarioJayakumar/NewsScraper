He worked with Baltimore Gas & Electric before starting his political career.He said he turned Harford County\u2019s budget around by \u201cholding the\u00a0line on taxes and launching digital platforms to improve efficiencies.\u201d\u201cI like to compare it to your latest smartphone version smaller, faster, and with better service,\u201d he said. \u201cI have shown that with the right balance we can fund education and public safety, and grow economic development through innovation and good government.\u201dMileah Kromer is a political science professor at Goucher College.She said Maryland presents a challenge for any Republican hoping to win in a state-wide election and added that\u2019s probably why the county executive is announcing his candidacy so early on.\u201cHe\u2019s going to have the entire summer to travel around the state, meeting Republicans from all across the state, and trying to get that name recognition up,\u201d Kromer said.That being said, Gov. Larry Hogan is a Republican and has won his last two elections.If he won, he would succeed Democrat Peter Franchot.Franchot has held the seat for the last 14 years and was one of the first people to announce his run for Maryland governor.\u201cI think most politicians these days just use the shortcut of, \u2018Vote for me because I\u2019ve spent a lot of money for you,'\u201d Franchot said. \u201cBut what about the results for the six million citizens and residents of the state? That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to ask them to judge me on.\u201dSo far, he\u2019s running against a handful of Democratic hopefuls.In a video message released this week, Republican Secretary of Commerce Kelly Schulz said her name will also be on the ballot.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/04/15/harford-county-executive-barry-glassman-announces-candidacy-for-maryland-comptroller/", "date": "April 15, 2021 at 3:45 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:28:53.371715"}
