{"title": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama On Derek Chauvin Verdict: \u2018There\u2019s Still Work To Be Done\u2019", "body": " \u2014 Former first lady Michelle Obama says she was relieved that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd, but that more work needs to be done to keep Black Americans safe. that she and her husband felt compelled to speak out following the verdict last month, when a jury found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\u201cWe know that while we\u2019re all breathing a sigh of relief over the verdict, there\u2019s still work to be done. And so we, we can\u2019t sort of say, \u2018Great. That happened. Let\u2019s move on,'\u201d Obama said. \u201cI know that people in the Black community don\u2019t feel that way because many of us still live in fear.\u201dObama said many Black Americans experience fear as they grocery shop, walk their dogs and drive. She expressed worry about her own daughters, Sasha and Malia.\u201cEvery time they get in a car by themselves, I worry about what assumption is being made by somebody who doesn\u2019t know everything about them. The fact that they are good students and polite girls. But maybe they\u2019re playin\u2019 their music a little loud. Maybe somebody sees the back of their head and makes an assumption,\u201d she said. \u201cThe innocent act of getting a license puts fear in our hearts.\u201dFollowing the verdict, the Obamas released a statement saying that the Minnesota jury \u201cdid the right thing\u201d in convicting Chauvin, but noting that \u201ctrue justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial.\u201d\u201cI think we have to talk about it more. And we have to ask our fellow citizens to listen a bit more, and to believe us, and to know we don\u2019t wanna be out there marchin\u2019. I mean, all those Black Lives Matters kids, they\u2019d rather not have to worry about this. They\u2019re takin\u2019 to the streets because they have to. They\u2019re tryin\u2019 to have people understand that we\u2019re real folks, and the fear that many have of so many of us is irrational. And it\u2019s based on a history that is just, it\u2019s sad and it\u2019s dark. And it\u2019s time for us to move beyond that.\u201dOn Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the four former Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd, including Chauvin, accusing them of violating his constitutional rights as he was pinned to the pavement and died gasping for air. Chauvin also faces a separate indictment accusing of violating the rights of a 14-year-old boy during an arrest in 2017.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/07/michelle-obama-derek-chauvin-verdict/", "date": "May 7, 2021 at 11:54 am", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:28:26.201515"}
