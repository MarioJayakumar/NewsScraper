That prompted the resort town to pass the emergency ordinance in June 2017.\u201cWe will not allow women to go topless on our beach or any public property within the city limits of Ocean City.\u201d Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan .\u201cWhy is it necessary to pass an emergency ordinance to say a female has to be covered up?\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, Devon Jacob, argued.\u201cThe city\u2019s interest is of course in preserving and protecting the character of Ocean City, the moral sensibilities of its residents and visitors.\u201d Bruce Bright, Ocean City attorney, said in 2017.Maryland is one of several states with ambiguous topless laws. Some cities like Austin, Texas, Boulder, Colorado, and Madison, Wisconsin have what\u2019s known as \u201ctop freedom.\u201d But some fear the family friendly feel of Ocean City could be in jeopardy if toplessness becomes the norm.\u201cThe beach is something that we\u2019re trying to incorporate as a family,\u201d one beach visitor told WJZ  of the controversy. \u201cIt would turn us away and we would just go elsewhere.\u201d", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/06/fight-for-women-to-be-topless-in-ocean-city-back-in-court/", "date": "May 6, 2021 at 10:25 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:28:38.635540"}
