The actor and comedian is hosting \u201cKids Say The Darndest Things\u201d on CBS, which premieres tonight at 8pm EST/PST and she also has a new movie with Billy Crystal called \u201cHere Today\u201d that comes out on Friday, May 7.CBS Local\u2019s DJ Sixsmith caught up with Haddish to discuss what it was like to host the show, working with Billy Crystal and how \u201cGirls Trip\u201d changed the trajectory of her career in Hollywood.\u201cWe need all the funny we can get because it\u2019s a situation out there,\u201d said Haddish. \u201cThe experience has been really good. I don\u2019t know if it is because of COVID, but these kids are super smart. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they have access to phones or if they don\u2019t know what an encyclopedia is, but they are five times more advanced than I ever was. Some of them are smarter than me, let\u2019s be honest. They\u2019re really funny. This show is not about me, it\u2019s about these kids. I like to share the platform and hear their point of view on the world. It\u2019s really important to listen to our children. They\u2019re hilarious, insightful and a little too grown.\u201dY'all ready?! Catch me on the season premiere of  Wednesday, May 5 at 8/7c on CBS. \u2014 Tiffany Haddish (@TiffanyHaddish) Recently, Haddish won a GRAMMY Award for Best Comedy Album and found out the news on the set of \u201cKids Say The Darndest Things.\u201d Haddish became the first Black woman to win the award since Whoopi Goldberg in the 1980s and it was unforgettable to share that moment with little girls from the show.\u201cIt was huge and amazing and to be able to share it with those young ladies was tremendous,\u201d said Haddish. \u201cThere is a part of me that wants to believe it was so powerful and magical and that they\u2019ll never forget it. There\u2019s this other part of me that is like \u2018I freakin\u2019 won man.\u2019 It was great to share that with them.\u201dWhile Haddish has worked with many great people during her comedy and acting career, she recently got the chance to work with legendary actor and director Billy Crystal. It\u2019s an experience that Haddish will never forget.\u201cThe coolest part was being able to tap into Billy Crystal\u2019s mind and see how that works,\u201d said Haddish. \u201cI just learned so much from him and Alan Zweibel who wrote it. I just felt like I was in the best, most fun college course on how to be an awesome entertainer. It\u2019s really fun in some parts and in some parts it snatches your heart. It\u2019s so beautiful and he taught me so much about how to be more simple and just being comfortable with being. I love that man and I loved everything I learned from him. It was a great experience.\u201d", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/05/tiffany-haddish-cbs-kids-say-the-darndest-things-interview/", "date": "May 5, 2021 at 12:00 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:27:42.546844"}
