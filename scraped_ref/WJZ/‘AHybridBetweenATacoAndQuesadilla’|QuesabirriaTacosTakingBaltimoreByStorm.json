Many people wait for hours with tacos selling out daily.\u201cThis is what they\u2019re waiting for! This is what they come for right now,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cThey dip it and then that keeps it in the broth that it was cooked in and then they just take a big bite!\u201dAcross town at Cocina Luchadoras, Rosyln Vera said she never had birria on her menu until customers started asking for it.\u201cThey were demanding,\u201d Vera said. \u201cSo I had to start.\u201dNow, they sell out regularly. Vera said each taco is made with a whole lot of love.\u201cEven if you had a bad day and you want to have a hug with a taco, this is where the place is,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/04/06/quesabirria-tacos-baltimore-maryland-restaurants-latest/", "date": "April 6, 2021 at 11:00 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:29:05.891568"}
