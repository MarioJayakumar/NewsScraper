{"title": "\u2018What A Crazy Birth Story\u2019: Maryland Mom Shares How She Delivered Her Baby While COVID Positive", "body": " Lauren Swope\u2019s daughter Arabella will have quite the story to tell when she grows up.\u201cWhat a crazy birth story she has, especially because the outcome was what we wanted it to be,\u201d Swope said.Swope, now a mother of three, was a patient at University of Maryland Medical Center \u2014 battling COVID for a second time \u2014 when she went into labor.\u201cDuring that time is when I really had no exposure to my family or anybody. I was here in the hospital,\u201d Swope said. \u201cYour anxiety naturally just goes through the roof and I felt that 100 percent.\u201dSwope described the ventilator being on hand as she was about to give birth to her daughter. She, her husband and their two older children all tested positive for COVID-19 at the time.\u201cI only had Dr. Crimmins on one side and a nurse on my other side holding my hand and they were really just cheering me on the entire time,\u201d Swope said, describing how she needed a central line and general anesthesia. She said a nurse, Nicole Sweeney, held her hand throughout the insertion of catheter lines.\u201cTrying to make sure patients feel supported in the absence of their family is probably the biggest challenge,\u201d UMMC Director of Nursing and Patient Care Services for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health Monika Bauman said. \u201cDuring this pandemic, all of us probably have a greater appreciation to what that human touch does for us. It\u2019s something as nurses that we just naturally do.\u201dArabella was born happy, healthy, COVID-negative and likely, mom said, with COVID antibodies. Swope said she and her family are now fully recovered from the virus.", "url": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/05/07/lauren-swope-covid-positive-mom-gives-birth-to-daughter/", "date": "May 7, 2021 at 6:25 pm", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:29:09.235576"}
