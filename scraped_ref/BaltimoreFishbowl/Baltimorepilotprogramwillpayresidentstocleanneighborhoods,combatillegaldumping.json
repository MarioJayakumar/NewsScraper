At the completion of the pilot program, those individuals will be trained for full-time employment with the public works department.Mark Washington, executive director of the Coldstream Homestead Montebello Community Corporation, said that with city resources residents will be able to \u201ctackle the scourge that is illegal dumping in Baltimore City.\u201d\u201cMy grandmother used to say it\u2019s not where you live but how you live,\u201d Washington said. \u201cToday with the support of Mayor Brandon Scott, our [city government] partners, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, and Healthy Neighborhoods, the communities of Coldstream Homestead Montebello choose to live with illegal dumping no more. Today we choose to be the change.\u201dOver the years, Scott said, he has spent more hours cleaning up CHM than any other neighborhood.\u201cWhat I always appreciated about coming to CHM for a community cleanup is it was community-driven,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt was not \u2018Let\u2019s wait for the city,\u2019 not \u2018Let\u2019s wait for someone else.\u2019 It was \u2018How can we take responsibility for our community and be a part of cleaning it up?\u2019\u201dWashington, of the community corporation, said he is pleased that residents will now be paid for the work they have long been doing in their communities.\u201cProviding skill development and living wage employment opportunities for young people from the community to act as agents of change in their community is a vital component of this pilot program,\u201d he said.Public Works Acting Director Matthew Garbark said the program will free his staff to focus on larger projects.\u201cCollaboration with community groups improves the work we do and improves beautification of the city,\u201d he said.Garbark added that department will funnel service requests in the area to CHM\u2019s cleaning crew. The city will review photos from before and after cleanups to keep records of the efforts.The pilot program is being funded through a combined $70,000 of grants from the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development and the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation.Baltimore City Councilwoman Odette Ramos (District 14) said she is working with her fellow council members to increase fees for people who participate in illegal dumping.\u201cThis is a community dedicated to making sure that nobody else dumps on our neighborhood,\u201d she said.Scott said the city is also relying on community members to report vehicles that are used for illegal dumping so that officials can track them down.Scott also promoted Baltimore\u2019s \u201cSpring Cleanup Saturday\u201d event on April 24, when residents will be encouraged to clean where they live.\u201cYou clean in front of your house, your step, your stoop, your gutter,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to bring back: that sense of self-responsibility that all of us have.\u201dResidents can call 311 or visit  to register their neighborhood to receive bags for their local cleanup.Explore Baltimore Fishbowl Baltimore Concert Opera to present two outdoor concerts in April Nearly 1.4 million Marylanders are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 Hot House: Historic mansion on three acres in the heart of Guilford A Peek Inside John Waters's Baltimore Home Topgolf has paused new construction, but BDC still expects work on Baltimore location by the summer A Linguist Explains the Baltimore Accent (and Kathy Bates)", "url": "https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/baltimore-pilot-program-will-pay-residents-to-clean-neighborhoods-combat-illegal-dumping/", "date": "2021-04-12T16:36:39+00:00"}
