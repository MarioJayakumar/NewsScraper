{"title": "Welcome to Literature: My encounter with Larry McMurtry", "body": "Author Larry McMurtry died last month \u2014 Thursday, March 25 \u2014 at his home in the Texas town of Archer City, its population of 1,800 overshadowed several hundred times by the number of books he amassed there.The store \u2014 Booked Up \u2014 is not far from the ranch where he grew up, the inspiration for much of his work. Best known for his 1985 novel  (itself better known as the TV adaptation starring Robert Duvall) \u2014 McMurtry died of heart failure at age 84.In the novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986, protagonist Augustus McCrae says, \u201cThe earth is mostly just a boneyard. But pretty in the sunlight.\u201dMcMurtry, who\u2019d \u201cbeen interested all my life in vanishing breeds,\u201d now rests among those bones.Over the summer of 2000, not long before leaving a collapsing newspaper industry, I drove to Archer City to meet McMurtry. He isn\u2019t one of my literary heroes (I have not read or seen ) but had charmed me with one of his not-about-cowboys novels, 1972\u2019s The visit to the intersection of state routes 79 and 25 was one of many stops on a 10,000 mile road trip/do-it-yourself book tour; a six-week jaunt around the nation\u2019s perimeter from Baltimore to the Badlands and down the coast of California before turning east for the Lone Star State and back to Crabtown; myself and my 17-year-old son Jake in a\u00a0 1999 \u201cNew Beetle.\u201dThe back of the metallic blue Bug was jammed with cases of my just released story collection from which I gave readings at crowded house parties, remote state parks and absolutely deserted bookstores. I hoped to sign one for McMurtry.On the last leg of the trip in Nashville, a store clerk felt so sorry for me \u2014 just me and her, a plate of cookies and 30 empty folding chairs \u2014 that she suggested I take a half-dozen books from the shelves in compensation. Staring out at those chairs, nibbling a cookie and hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to read for a latecomer who wouldn\u2019t buy a book anyway, I thought, \u201cI\u2019ve made it now.\u201dJake bailed after Las Vegas to spend the rest of the summer with friends before his senior year of high school. From Vegas it was 1,100 miles east to Archer City where I looked forward to talking craft with a master known for brilliance and inconsistency.[The late author Jim Harrison (1937-to-2016) \u2014 referencing McMurtry\u2019s 1970 novel \u2014 said that while scenes from the book were unforgettable he was \u201cvery much put off by a peculiar laxness in the writing.\u201d Then again, how can you not be inconsistent while publishing some 30 novels, half-as-many books of non-fiction and screenplays? Perhaps it\u2019s a question for Joyce Carol Oates.]Before leaving Baltimore, I wrote McMurtry an old fashioned, handwritten letter from  City Desk and mailed it to his store at 216 South Center Street. He soon replied in his own hand, saying he\u2019d be happy to talk.In the days prior to arriving in mid-August, I fretted that I wasn\u2019t able to reach McMurtry \u2014 then 64, a year older than I am now \u2014 by phone to confirm when I\u2019d be showing up. Surely he\u2019d remember his cordial response to a letter from a reporter on letterhead.I was told that the boss was \u201cin the stacks,\u201d and was pointed to the aisle where he stood on a tall ladder appraising books. I remember looking up at him on that ladder \u2014 tired, sweaty and begrimed with dust \u2014 and telling him who I was and why I was there. He had no recollection of our correspondence but told me that he\u2019d be down in a moment. I waited for him by a\u00a0 desk at the front.Joining me, wiping sweat from his brow with a handkerchief, McMurtry\u2019s polite but not quite friendly vibe felt like someone fielding mundane inquiries at a hardware store: What can I do for you?If he had been the fabled Baltimore newspaper vendor Abe Sherman [1898-to-1987] he may simply have thrown me out.In a remembrance of McMurtry in last month\u2019s , the writer Skip Hollandsworth \u2014 who had spent far more time with the author than my one-and-only experience \u2014 recounted much the same.\u201cHe was not always the friendliest man,\u201d wrote Hollandsworth. \u201c\u2026 he always seemed bored and changed the subject whenever I asked him about his accomplishments. He grunted at my queries about his \u2018writing process.\u2019\u201dAt no time, recalled Hollandsworth, on whom McMurtry once hung up in the middle of a phone call  goodbye, \u201cdid I ever hear him laugh out loud.\u201dKnowing that now, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that he neither recalled nor wanted to revisit the line from  that inspired me to drive a thousand miles to pay my respects.It\u2019s a book about a Houston writer breaking into the business after much hard work and manifold entanglements romantic, sexual, and geographic. The protagonist, Danny Deck, spends many hours alone in a rundown hotel, banging out stories while subsisting on Fritos and Fig Newtons.It reminded me of my long-ago mentor Tom Nugent (who one day stopped speaking to me without explanation) and the time in 1978 that he moved into the Congress Hotel on Franklin Street to write about the people living on half-a-shoestring.When Danny publishes his first novel, his ping-pong playing companion \u2014 a fellow writer named Wu whose unpublished manuscript \u201cwas a kind of literary Great Wall\u201d filling the shelves of his pantry, congratulates Deck.Between points in their game, Wu says, with sincerity rare in our digital moment, \u201cWelcome to literature.\u201dWhat a moment!One day you\u2019re riding the bench on  night desk and the next a bookstore clerk you\u2019ve never met feels so sorry for you that she lets you pick out an armful of books as a balm for your embarrassment.When I dramatically repeated the line for McMurtry \u2014 \u201cWelcome to literature!\u201d \u2014 he made no response. I could sense he wanted to get this over with.\u00a0 My exit nearing, I decided to combine both of McMurtry\u2019s dominant pursuits into a single question.Which is more noxious, I asked, sexual envy or literary envy?Suddenly, Larry \u2014 who had shared an evening with Cybill Shepherd when the former girlfriend of Elvis starred in the adaptation of McMurtry\u2019s  \u2014 revived.\u201cLiterary, by far,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can feel it in the room\u2026\u201dExplore Baltimore Fishbowl Chesapeake Bay, Southern Maryland could see new federal park, heritage designations Maryland schools continue comparatively slow reopening plan Maryland to move 3,300 state employees to downtown Baltimore This TV Series About Maryland Wasn't Filmed in Maryland Domino Sugar Baltimore to replace its iconic Inner Harbor sign The Dark Past of Baltimore's Rosewood Mental Hospital", "url": "https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/welcome-to-literature-my-encounter-with-larry-mcmurtry/", "date": "2021-04-19T13:51:57+00:00"}
