{"title": "Maryland schools continue comparatively slow reopening plan", "body": "Maryland public school students have had some of the least opportunities in the nation to attend regular in-person instruction despite the state\u2019s moderate COVID-19 spread.Roughly half of normal in-person instruction is open in Maryland \u2014 the fifth-lowest in the nation as of April 13, Maryland ranks toward the middle of states in daily average of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days, at 23, according to the John Bailey, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute \u2014 a Washington, D.C.-based think tank \u2014  analyzing the  around the world regarding COVID-19 spread and schools.A common theme in these studies that the report details is that school re-openings, so long as they follow safety protocols, do not impact COVID-19 outbreaks in their surrounding communities.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of learning from the past year that we haven\u2019t adjusted it to the reopening of schools,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been grounding these decisions in evidence.\u201dBailey emphasized the contrast between early concerns about COVID-19 and children to the resulting research over the past year.While there were early concerns that children would be especially at risk to COVID-19 as they were to diseases like influenza, research has been clear that children, in terms of severity of symptoms, are at little to no risk of the coronavirus.Another concern was that children would spread the virus by going to school regularly, but research has consistently shown that children spread the virus at a lesser rate than adults.As of April 11, 59.4% of students in the country attend schools with a traditional everyday schedule, 28.4% attend schools with a hybrid schedule, and 12.2% attend schools that are virtual only, according to Burbio.\nNext week marks the final phase of the reopening plan in Maryland, as six districts, including Baltimore County and Montgomery County,  for more regular in-person instruction.While there is no public data on the amount of teachers vaccinated in Maryland, Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, told CNS her union is getting fewer calls from members asking about vaccination appointments.Bost said she\u2019s heard some concerns from her members regarding lackadaisical enforcements of safety protocols and the quality of HVAC systems in aging school buildings.Bost added that there could be more transparency at the state level in terms of detailing the number of COVID-19 cases in schools \u2014 a common theme nationwide.The Maryland State Department of Education  showing that in the second quarter of the school year (November 2020 to January 2021), jurisdictions with a middle school student failure rate of 20% in math and science increased by 800% in comparison to the previous year.The data for high school students shows an 800% increase for math and a 300% increase for science. Increases in failure rates of English and social studies trended in similar directions.When asked about the trend, Bost said that Maryland is not alone and that the comparison to a year with a pandemic is unfair.\u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does your electric bill compare to other years? We\u2019re home a lot more now.\u201dBost did not express any concern that Maryland students could be falling further behind than states with more in-person instruction.Bost instead pointed with optimism to the recently passed, multi-billion dollar annual education plan, Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which is set to increase teacher pay, direct additional resources to poverty-stricken jurisdictions, and create new career training opportunities in schools.\u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunities moving forward with the Blueprint plan,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be so much more opportunity here in Maryland now.\u201dBailey attributed the hesitancy of school reopenings in areas like Maryland in part to partisan fights and labor union conflicts.\u201cA lot of people have played into fear mongering,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe should have been celebrating these insights that we\u2019ve been learning and highlighting these best practices.\u201dLooking ahead, Bailey said analyzing the impact of a lack of in-person instruction over the past year will focus on three main aspects.The short-term effects, which he said are mostly being studied now, focus on the academic progress and mental health of students.Then, he said, there\u2019s the \u201cmedium term\u201d \u2014 which regards college and career decisions.In the long term, he said, shortcomings in these areas could lead to lost earnings and economic opportunity.Explore Baltimore Fishbowl Maryland confirms more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases for third straight day as average case rate continues to climb John Waters joins the cast of 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Thursday Afternoon Headlines: Postal worker says COVID outbreak causing mail delays; Arundel Live! casino prepares for sports gambling; Police warn of potential child abductions in Woodlawn; and more.
