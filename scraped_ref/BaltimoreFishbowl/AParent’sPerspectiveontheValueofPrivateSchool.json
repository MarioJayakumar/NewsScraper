{"title": "A Parent\u2019s Perspective on the Value of Private School", "body": "Brendt Stier,\u00a0 a pharmacologist, spent most of 2020 developing Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 clinical trials prior to the December 2020 vaccine roll-out. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great experience to learn so much about the virus and to find innovative ways to help our clients treat or prevent the COVID-19 virus,\u201d says Stier, senior director of value and development consulting with PPD, Moderna\u2019s strategic development partner. \u201cEvery day I\u2019m reading scientific journals, textbooks, etc. to learn about the latest trends or therapies for a particular disease.\u201dWhen it came time to choose the best educational option for their son, Stier and his wife Liz wanted a school that embraced their passion for lifelong learning. Like many parents, they did their research. \u201cWe explored the public school system because we wanted to see what they had to offer and quickly realized that the larger class sizes and multiple grade levels really wasn\u2019t what we were looking for,\u201d Stier explains.They chose , a Preschool through 8th grade, coed, Episcopalian school in Monkton, Md., for their son Jason, who is in 1st grade. Since fall 2020, SJA, which commemorates its 200th anniversary this year, has had in-person learning five days per week since the beginning of the 2020-21 school year.\u201cSt. James values teaching children how to learn and how to love to learn,\u201d Stier says of the school\u2019s project-based curriculum. \u201cBeing comfortable with learning, asking questions, problem-solving, and learning from your experiences are skills St. James instills and are what we feel is necessary for our child\u2019s development.\u201dDr. Kathryn Nicholson, a cosmetic dermatologist who trained in internal medicine and nephrology, also chose St. James Academy for her son Billy (7th grade) and daughter Jillian (6th grade). For the past eight years, Nicholson has driven 140 miles round-trip from their home in York so her children could attend St. James Academy.\u201cThis is a testament to how much I value the education,\u201d she adds. \u201cMy children are part of a learning environment that\u2019s supportive, caring, and challenging. SJA\u2019s smaller class sizes really give the opportunity for children to have a much more focused and interactive learning experience.\u201dHer son\u2019s dinosaur research project in 1st grade is still fresh. \u201cAs he spoke to an audience of adults about the dinosaur that he had studied, I sat in awe,\u201d Nicholson says of SJA\u2019s focus on public speaking. \u201cI had not spoken on a stage until I was a high school senior.\u201d Since her children have had multiple public-speaking and collaborative small-group projects. Stier adds that these experiences go well beyond mastering subject matter. \u201cBeing able to learn but also respect other\u2019s viewpoints and have meaningful discussions are very relevant in today\u2019s world,\u201d he says. \u201cBuilding confidence at an early age builds the\u00a0 foundation for great future leaders.\u201dNicholson particularly appreciates SJA\u2019s approach now that her children are in middle school. \u201cWhile I wish my children could continue at SJA through high school, I also feel that it is valuable to have a Preschool-8 experience,\u201d she explains. \u201cAt SJA, middle school students are the older role models. This engenders leadership skills and raises the bar of expectation for the older students without the high school students looming above them.\u201d\u201cSJA is a place that focuses on all aspects of our children\u2019s growth simultaneously,\u201d Nicholson says. \u201cThey can try new things to identify their own interests and strengths.\u201d Private schools typically have extensive co-curricular offerings. At SJA, there are rec leagues for PreKindergarten through 5th grade, Middle School interscholastic sports, numerous performing arts opportunities, an array of afterschool clubs to explore new passions.SJA has numerous outlets for curiosity and a faculty devoted to academic rigor while \u201callowing students to push their own limits with confidence,\u201d Nicholson says. \u201cAs a scientist, it\u2019s not enough to simply know something is true. One always wants to know why it is true and how we know that it is true. It is from these kinds of queries that new and innovative thoughts arise. SJA students are encouraged to think beyond the facts they learn. Everything that is done at SJA is done deliberately with specific intention.\u201dAt SJA, parents are part of that intentional community. Last year, Stier was tapped to coach soccer for his son\u2019s class. \u201cMy wife and I had a great time working with the students and interacting with other parents,\u201d he says of the SJA parent volunteer opportunities that include field trips, parent social events, classroom activities, and serving daily lunches.Nicholson adds that there \u201cis a culture of kindness, integrity, and responsibility that our children are immersed in at SJA\u201d \u2013 values that she sees as timely and timeless. \u201cAs always, but perhaps particularly now, values such as empathy and open-mindedness are essential,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are all values that our students recite every day in the St. James honor code and are taught by example from teachers, faculty, and fellow students.\u201dDiscover the value of a St. James Academy education and meet Dr. Nicholson and other St. James Middle School parents on April 27, 7 PM, at the. During this live event, interested parents and students can see classroom demonstrations and meet SJA students, parents, and faculty.\u00a0 Learn more about the school at.Explore Baltimore Fishbowl Friday Afternoon Headlines: Elon Musk removes Baltimore-D.C. tunnel from project list; New health laws draw praise; Free youth horseback riding program in Baltimore; and more.
