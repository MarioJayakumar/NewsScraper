{"title": "Columbia psychologist Brad Sachs treats freewheeling emotions", "body": "Peering at COVID-19\u2019s roiling effects through a steady, objective lens, Brad Sachs, a Columbia psychologist, doesn\u2019t mince words when articulating the pandemic\u2019s staggering damage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWe tend not to have as comprehensive a portrait of our species as we should,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a true measure of our susceptibility. That fed our denial.\u201dBefore the pandemic erupted across the globe, Sachs was working with couples on issues relating to domestic abuse.\u201cSharing household responsibilities exacerbated the intensity of the struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever fault line or fissure already in place in the marriage\u201d only grew deeper and wider during the pandemic, said Sachs, 64, a member of Oseh Shalom, a Reconstructionist congregation in Laurel.The once-in-a-century pandemic will be remembered for how it so insidiously interrupted daily rhythms worldwide. In the United States, there have been 30 million cases of the disease, with more than 560,000 deaths reported.Sachs hastened to add that \u201cthe better case scenario was being able to work from home. The harder job was losing your job. That was even worse.\u201d From a dollars and cents perspective, whenever a household income is lost or significantly reduced, freewheeling emotions can be unleashed.When a couple seeks his counsel for helping them deconstruct their individual worries, Sachs crafts a game plan.\u201cThe husband is worried about finances. The wife is worried about hygiene. They were each worried about the same thing. They were just managing it differently.\u201dThe takeaway: \u201cThat\u2019s when you sense you\u2019re on the same team. That\u2019s what gets you through.\u201dHe often packs more clear-eyed pragmatism to-go: \u201cMy general philosophy with patients is trying to make things easy creates great difficulty.\u201dSachs has written about best practices for treating couples in peril during the coronavirus. In one essay, Sachs showcased the clinical advantages of conducting Zoom therapy with his clients. \u201cWe are able to obtain a glimpse of the couple\u2019s home environment \u2014 furnishings, wall hanging, lighting, etc. \u2014 that might illuminate aspects\u201d of their milieu.At the same time, he noted, so as to fill up computer screens with their images, couples may find themselves seated closer to each other than they would during in-person therapy. That arrangement, he noted, provides a snapshot \u201cof the geography of their interaction.\u201dSachs, a Philadelphia native who went to Brown and holds a Ph.D., sports a thick resume. Along with the 10 books he\u2019s written, including \u201cThe Good Enough Therapist: Futility, Failure and Forgiveness in Treatment,\u201d he conducts lectures and workshops, and has appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show. He also finds the time to write and perform music. In one song, \u201cHard Tales to Tell,\u201d he pointed out \u201ceach song is a journey into the heart of the human predicament, and explores the bittersweet themes of loss and love, of sorrow and redemption, that all of us encounter in our lives.\u201dIf that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s been running The Father Center for more than 30 years. The workshop allows men to ponder the ramifications of \u201cbeing and becoming dads.\u201d In its early days, the program focused on providing some of the tools needed by expectant and new dads. Over time, though, topics such as stepfathers, adoptive fathers, single fathers and fathers of special needs children became part of the mix.When children witness verbal and physical abuse in the home \u2014 particularly the very young \u2014 they have scant control over what they\u2019re being exposed to, Sachs said. \u201cThey have no choice but to react to it.\u201dWhen possible, having children present during therapy creates a window for him to inform his analysis. \u201cI pick up on their distress in voice and body language. Kids are unerring temperature takers.\u201dSachs extolled the value of hope: \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to get us through the adversity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a resilient species and we need to adapt.\u201d", "url": "https://www.jewishtimes.com/columbia-psychologist-brad-sachs-treats-freewheeling-emotions/", "date": "2021-04-30T12:03:42-04:00", "access_date": "2021-05-07T22:17:55.918342"}
