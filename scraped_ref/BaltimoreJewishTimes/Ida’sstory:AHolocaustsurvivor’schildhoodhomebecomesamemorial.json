{"title": "Ida\u2019s story: A Holocaust survivor\u2019s childhood home becomes a memorial", "body": "Pikesville resident Ida Schmidt-Chait (n\u00e9e Rosenberg) learned of the Ringelblum Archive during a trip back to Poland in 2017, more than six decades after she left her birthplace behind. It was there, right outside the apartment building where she had lived in Warsaw, that she learned that the basement of her childhood home had sheltered some of the Ringelblum documents.Many stories from the Warsaw Ghetto are only known today through the survival of this archive, put together by a group that had lived there during the German occupation. (Only three members survived the war.) The archives contain testimonials, artifacts and documents that were hidden away for preservation. After World War II, they were dug up and recovered among the ruins that Warsaw had been reduced to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast month, Schmidt-Chait\u2019s childhood home became the location of a new Holocaust memorial honoring the Ringelblum Archive.The archive is a \u201ctime capsule,\u201d said Aleksandra Engler-Malinowska of Warsaw, who worked to create the memorial. Engler-Malinowska is a public relations and cultural manager and a member of the Social Committee for Ringelblum Archive Commemoration and the Warsaw-based Statia Moranov, two of the organizations behind the memorial.\u201cIt became, not only the archival material, but also a source for all the Holocaust researchers, scientists, \u2026 it played a role in the trials against the Nazi Germans who were responsible for the Holocaust,\u201d Engler-Malinowska said.The archive contains thousands of documents detailing life and death inside the ghetto, but Schmidt-Chait has a different story to tell.\u00a0Schmidt-Chait was 8 years old in 1939. Her family lived in Warsaw, at 68 Nowolipki St., on the second floor of a red-brick apartment building, with a courtyard outside that had a fountain, flowers and children playing hopscotch and hide-and-seek. Her father, Israel, worked as a master tailor, with a special room reserved for his craft. She spoke only Polish before the war and attended a Polish school where she sang Polish songs. She would take trips with her parents to local parks, to boating excursions on the Vistula river and to the cinema to watch Shirley Temple films.\u201cThere were very beautiful areas of the parks, and streets, and children that I played with,\u201d Schmidt-Chait recalled. \u201cAs a child I had wonderful experiences.\u201dIn the summer of 1939, Schmidt-Chait\u2019s parents had their hands full with their 18-month-old daughter Celia, so Schmidt-Chait was sent to spend several months with her grandparents, Moishe and Rachel, in the community of Siedlce. After, Schmidt-Chait began preparing to return to Warsaw for the school year.\u00a0On Sept. 1, 1939, the German army invaded Poland, overrunning the country in a matter of weeks.\u201cI remember the bombardment, when they were bombarding the cities and where I was with my grandparents, all the bombs that were coming down and the buildings were coming apart,\u201d Schmidt-Chait said.Schmidt-Chait\u2019s grandfather resolved to get his family out of the country with haste, she said. Germany and the Soviet Union were not yet at war, so he went to a local station with trains bound for Russia.\u201cMy grandfather went over at night to the Russian commandant,\u201d Schmidt-Chait said, \u201cand he asked if he would take us on the train. And he would pay him any kind of money, or any kind of goods that they want[ed] to take us on the train.\u201dIn the middle of the night, the family packed a small bag and Schmidt-Chait left Poland with her grandparents, three aunts and an uncle. They eventually arrived in Brest-Litovsk in modern-day Belarus.As for her family in Warsaw, her father served in the army during the German invasion. After the Polish surrender, he returned to Warsaw from his service. Her parents snuck out of the city and reunited with Schmidt-Chait in the USSR.Many other members of Schmidt-Chait\u2019s family perished, said Schmidt-Chait\u2019s son, Martin Schmidt.In 1940, the Soviets began deporting Poles living in their borders to forced labor camps in Siberia. Schmidt-Chait and her family were sent to a camp in the Komi Republic, on the Siberian border. Situated within a forest and next to a river, men and women chopped wood by hand to be sent downstream.\u201cPeople were committing suicide there,\u201d Schmidt-Chait said. \u201cThere was no food, there was malaria, typhoid fever, dysentery. And I, until today, and I tell that to my four children and grandchildren, I do not know how we survived.\u201dAs bad as things were in the camp, Schmidt-Chait understands that things could have been much worse.\u201cIn one respect, this is the only way that we survived,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise we would be in Warsaw, we would have been in the Warsaw Ghetto. \u2026 I\u2019m very fortunate.\u201dWhen the Soviets joined the Allies after the Nazis\u2019 surprise attack, the USSR changed its policy and allowed Poles in its borders to leave the camps, Schmidt said, though the German occupation made returning home out of the question. Schmidt-Chait traveled by box car for 30 days and nights with her family through Asia\u2019s central steppes, eventually arriving in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, where they remained until the war\u2019s end.\u00a0After the German defeat, Schmidt-Chait returned with her family to Poland in 1946. But with pogroms spreading through the country, they soon realized Poland was no longer safe for them. They left for Czechoslovakia and then Germany, ending up in a displaced persons camp run by the U.S. military. They remained there until 1949, when Schmidt-Chait emigrated with her family to New York.There, Schmidt-Chait met the man who would become her husband, an engineer who would find a job with AT&T. Later on, the company decided to send its engineers out to different parts of the U.S. to be closer to the customers. Schmidt-Chait and her husband opted for the Baltimore area, as they wanted to remain relatively close to their relatives in New York.Witnessing so much suffering during the war left Schmidt-Chait with a desire to become a doctor, she said. While this did not happen, she started college to become a nurse when her youngest daughter began first grade. She worked at Saint Agnes Hospital and Sinai Hospital.Schmidt-Chait previously belonged to Beth Israel Congregation.Schmidt-Chait and her husband, who was also a survivor, were unusually open about their experiences during the Holocaust, Schmidt said.\u201cThey were atypical,\u201d he said. \u201cI know friends and people whose parents didn\u2019t talk about it. My parents did.\u201cIt really gave us an appreciation of the hardships, of what their life was like before,\u201d Schmidt said.\u00a0Schmidt-Chait did not return to Poland until 2017, during a trip with several of her children. They hired a guide named Pawe\u0142 Szczerkowski for a full-day tour and requested that they swing by her family\u2019s old home at 68 Nowolipki St.Before the family arrived at the old building, none of them had ever heard of the Ringelblum Archive. When they arrived, Szczerkowski told them the story.\u201c\u2018One of the places [where the archive was hidden] was the building at 68 Nowolipki where you lived, Ida,\u2019\u201d Schmidt recalled the guide saying. \u201c\u2018One of the caches was found in the basement.\u2019\u201cWe were dumbfounded,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cand we couldn\u2019t even believe it.\u201dSzczerkowski also told them that there were local groups working to create a memorial at the location.After they returned to the U.S. from Poland, Schmidt-Chait traveled with her son Martin to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in D.C. There, they found the milk can that had been buried in the basement of 68 Nowolipki St. and that had once stored many of the Ringelblum Archive documents. Unearthed on Dec. 1, 1950, the artifact was on display in D.C., on loan from Warsaw.The family wanted to be present for the memorial\u2019s unveiling on April 19, but the pandemic nixed their travel plans. Schmidt still plans to visit in the future and hopes to bring his mother there as well.\u00a0In addition to telling the family about the memorial, Szczerkowski connected them to Engler-Malinowska, who also grew up on Nowolipki Street, just opposite the building where Schmidt-Chait had lived.Engler-Malinowska first learned of the Ringelblum Archive while working for the Taube Center For The Renewal Of Jewish Life In Poland, which at the time was working with the Emanuel Ringelblum Jewish Historical Institute.Though not Jewish herself, she said her interest in Jewish history and culture comes from several places. She has had many Jewish friends throughout her life and had teachers who would speak of the Holocaust. \u201cI have to mention my grandfather, who specifically made me visit Auschwitz,\u201d she said. While the 17-year-old Engler-Malinowska was reluctant to go at the time, her grandfather told her, \u201cYou have to. That\u2019s your obligation. You have to go.\u201dShe came to recognize the Holocaust as \u201ca terrifying lesson about humanity and human beings\u201d and resolved \u201cto do something, my little part, to prevent this\u201d from happening again.Recently, Engler-Malinowska devoted her time to raking leaves in Warsaw\u2019s Jewish cemetery, Schmidt said. \u201cThat\u2019s how connected she is to the Jewish history,\u201d he said.Engler-Malinowska was even invited to attend Schmidt-Chait\u2019s birthday party on Zoom.\u201cThrough this memorial and through this whole project, I got connected with someone who was growing up before this whole tragedy happened,\u201d Engler-Malinowska said. \u201cSeparated by time, separated by the ocean, by the age, by religion, by everything. What makes us having a connection, besides the gender of us two, is the Nowolipki Street and Ringelblum commemoration.\u201d\u00a0Jacek Leociak, the co-author of \u201cThe Warsaw Ghetto: A Guide to the Perished City\u201d and a member of the informal group called the Social Committee for Ringelblum Archive Commemoration, had the initial idea for the memorial, Engler-Malinowska said. Two of the group\u2019s members, architects/artists Marcin Urbanek and \u0141ukasz Mieszkowski, worked on designs for it. In 2015, the organization Statia Moranov began pushing to make it a reality. In 2020, the project began receiving assistance from The Association of the Jewish Historical Institute.Schmidt described the memorial as \u201ca glass representation from the basement with the documents coming out.\u201d Engler-Malinowska said it is \u201ca glass cubicle which comes out from over the surface of the ground. If you look, there is a concrete cellar made, so it looks like it\u2019s coming out from the cellar.\u201dWithin the glass cube, Engler-Malinowska said, is a page from the last will of Dawid Graber, a 19-year-old student who helped hide the archive. \u201cIf you look at it today, it looks like this page of paper, it\u2019s flying over the street of Nowolipki,\u201d Engler-Malinowska said.The will, according to the Times of Israel, reads, \u201cWhat we were not able to pass through our cries and screams, we hid underground.\u201d", "url": "https://www.jewishtimes.com/idas-story-a-holocaust-survivors-childhood-home-becomes-a-memorial/", "date": "2021-05-05T13:51:43-04:00", "access_date": "2021-05-07T22:19:36.201379"}
