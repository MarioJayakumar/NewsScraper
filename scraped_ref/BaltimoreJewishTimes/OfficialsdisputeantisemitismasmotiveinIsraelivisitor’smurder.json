{"title": "Officials dispute antisemitism as motive in Israeli visitor\u2019s murder", "body": "Local officials are disputing antisemitism as a motive in the May 3 shooting death of Efraim Gordon, a 31-year-old Israeli who had come to Baltimore to attend a cousin\u2019s wedding. Gordon was shot outside of the home of his aunt and uncle where he was staying, according to JTA.The attack took place in a heavily Jewish part of Baltimore\u2019s northwest area on Fords Lane, according to JTA. Video surveillance reportedly shows three youths approaching Gordon, and one shooting him. Police arrived on the scene after midnight. Gordon was taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI was woken up at 1 a.m. by a phone call telling me there has been a murder in my neighborhood,\u201d Maryland state Del. Dalya Attar (D), a resident of Baltimore\u2019s Park Heights neighborhood, said in an email. \u201cMy initial reaction was fear and anger. The neighborhood of the murder has violent crime, but is generally safer than many parts of Baltimore.\u201d\u201cIt had been a very violent weekend in Baltimore,\u201d said Howard Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council, referring to a number of violent incidents in the area that included a shooting at Carroll Park over the weekend.\u201cTo hear that it had come to this area of northwest Baltimore was very disturbing,\u201d Libit continued. \u201cThis happened only a few blocks from the [Park Heights campus of the] JCC, so it\u2019s our neighborhood where we work, as well as where many of our community live.\u201dBased on his conversations with law enforcement officers and elected officials, Libit said that \u201cthis was an armed robbery that went horribly, horribly wrong.\u201dAt a press conference on May 5, Gordon\u2019s sister, Ella Gordon, called the murder \u201can act of terror,\u201d according to the Times of Israel. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t just die. There were no signs of violence, and they didn\u2019t take money,\u201d she said, adding that it \u201cwas not a robbery that went wrong, but murder due to antisemitism.\u201dShe noted that her brother was bearded and wore a kippah.Attar saw the situation differently. \u201cI have experienced antisemitism in the Baltimore area and I\u2019ve heard from many Jewish constituents of mine who have, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut from all the evidence I\u2019ve been made aware of, the accusations of antisemitic slurs being uttered at the time of the murder seem to be false.\u201dLibit agreed. \u201cTo my knowledge, there\u2019s no credible evidence of [antisemitic motivations],\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going to make accusations of things being a hate crime, you need to be careful.\u201dFollowing Gordon\u2019s death, a Chesed Fund page was set up to raise money for the $15,000 cost of transporting his body back to Israel, as well as other costs related to his burial. Gordon has since been buried in his native country, the page reported, and at the time of this writing had raised over $58,000 of its $75,000 goal. The page stated that some of the money raised would be used as a reward to help identify suspects.\u201cOur hearts go out to the family and friends,\u201d Libit said. \u201cNo one should be killed in the city of Baltimore, and no visitors to our city should be killed while they\u2019re here visiting.\u201dTo Israeli citizens who may now be second guessing a trip to the United States or to Baltimore, Attar offered reassurance. \u201cNot everywhere in the United States has the amount of violence as we have in Baltimore City,\u201d she said, noting that Baltimore \u201cis a beautiful city. It is my home. It\u2019s where I was born and raised and where my children were born and are being raised.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, violent crime is on the rise here, so if you plan on coming, please come and remain cognizant of your surroundings,\u201d Attar continued. \u201cWe have amazing communities here. Don\u2019t let this deter you.\u201d", "url": "https://www.jewishtimes.com/officials-dispute-antisemitism-as-motive-in-israeli-visitors-murder/", "date": "2021-05-07T11:59:31-04:00", "access_date": "2021-05-07T22:19:36.248139"}
