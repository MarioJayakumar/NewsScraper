{"title": "What is Israel\u2019s Mount Meron and why were so many Orthodox Jews gathered there for the Lag b\u2019Omer holiday?", "body": "\u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen the joy of Lag b\u2019Omer on the grave of Rabbiyou haven\u2019t seen joy at all,\u201d  the author Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Israel\u2019s first Nobel Prize laureate.That description reflects an aspect of the annual pilgrimage to Mount Meron in northern Israel that was underlined by the  on Friday of at least 45 revelers in a stampede: It is a place whose symbolism reflects a mix of grief and euphoria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndeed, the tragedy struck during what for many observant Jews is among the happiest days of the year: the cessation of a period of mourning between the holidays of Passover and Shavuot during which many observant Jews abstain from weddings and haircuts. And it occurred exactly 110 years after another disaster at the site that killed at least 10 pilgrims in 1911.Part of the reason for Friday\u2019s tragedy appears to be rooted in the pilgrimage site itself \u2013 a remote and archaeologically significant site where construction is complicated both practically and for religious reasons \u2014 and the euphoric mindset of some pilgrims. ties Lag b\u2019Omer to a plague that killed thousands of students of, among the greatest early rabbinic figures who legend has it was put to death by the Romans for defying their restrictions on teaching Torah. According to Jewish tradition, the plague ceased on Lag b\u2019Omer, making that date a time of celebration.Lag b\u2019Omer is also believed to be the date of death of, a prominent disciple of Rabbi Akiva and a major figure in Jewish mysticism, or Kabbalah, whose gravesite on Mount Meron is the locus of festivities. Bar Yochai\u2019s grave became a site for celebration because tradition has it that he asked his disciples to rejoice instead of mourn when they commemorate his death.In Israel, the celebration has become a colorful event, where tens of thousands of mostly Hasidic Jews dance into the night to a soundtrack as diverse as the revelers. It ranges from old hymns in Aramaic to Yiddish songs to techno music and Don McLean tunes sung to Hebrew lyrics celebrating the Torah.The pilgrimage to Mount Meron, located just outside the northern city of Safed, began in the 11th century at the gravesite of earlier sages \u2014  and Shammai the Elder \u2014 who are buried on the mountain as well. About 600 years ago, Shimon bar Yochai\u2019s grave also began attracting pilgrims, eventually eclipsing the earlier rabbis, according to historians.A plethora of unusual customs has emerged around the Lag B\u2019Omer pilgrimage. At one event, a white sheet is stretched on a stage and smeared with olive oil for long minutes in a ceremony that some believe corresponds to a mystical notion that wisdom can be absorbed through objects.Some young men also shoot bow and arrow while reciting their choice verses from the Bible as a means of fighting evil urges.Amid the euphoric dancing and eccentric activities, revelers often display kindness and express brotherly love. It is not uncommon for revelers to hug. Entire dance parties routinely grind to a halt whenever one of the dancers loses their yarmulke so that the ritual object can be retrieved from the ground.Women, particularly the newly devout, also flock to Mount Meron on Lag B\u2019Omer, which has a separate women\u2019s section. They pray passionately for hours.The event\u2019s pinnacle is the lighting of the traditional Lag b\u2019Omer fire as the crowd recites, mantra-like, \u201cbizchut hatanah Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai\u201d \u2014 Hebrew for \u201cin the merit of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of the Tannaim,\u201d a reference to the  who flourished in the first two centuries of the Common Era.That\u2019s exactly the moment when the Mount Meron pilgrimage tragedy happened in 1911. As thousands climbed a stone staircase to see the fire, the structure collapsed, killing at least 10 people.\u201cSuddenly the frail metal railing tore off the roof, collapsing and dragging with it heavy rocks and the masses of people on it tumbled into the dense crowd below,\u201d the Hapoel Hatzair journal  about the incident. \u201cA terrible sight unfolded, the buildings rocks and the metal rods appeared to have fused into a pitiless wrecking machine, there are 10 dead and 30 wounded. The feast became a beast, rivers of blood and streams of tears washed over the sage\u2019s compound.\u201dShmuel Yosef Agnon was there, too.\u201cI stood among them when they were alive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd then I carried their bodies.\u201d", "url": "https://www.jewishtimes.com/what-is-israels-mount-meron-and-why-were-so-many-orthodox-jews-gathered-there-for-the-lag-bomer-holiday/", "date": "2021-04-30T14:33:14-04:00", "access_date": "2021-05-07T22:20:09.487727"}
