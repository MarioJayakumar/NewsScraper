{"title": "Pikesville native returns home to film cooking show", "body": "When families sit down to watch a show about American barbecuing, they may not be expecting to be greeted by a self-described Jewish intellectual who was born in Japan and has a degree in French literature. And yet, on Maryland Public Television\u2019s \u201cProject Fire\u201d series, the third season of which was shot at the Pearlstone Center, that is exactly what they will get in Steven Raichlen, the show\u2019s creator and host.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m a Jewish intellectual from barbecue, practicing an art that was traditionally done by cowboys or people of very different ethnic origins than myself, I think people probably are surprised by that, or were surprised by that,\u201d he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cProject Fire\u201d shows viewers how to barbecue different dishes from across the country and around the world.Raichlen and his team chose to film all 13 episodes of the series\u2019 third season at Pearlstone for practical and personal reasons.In terms of practicality, the majority of the film crew lives in Maryland, Raichlen said. They needed a location that would be easy for staff to get to and live at for the duration of filming while distancing from the outside world, and Pearlstone\u2019s living spaces happened to be available.As for its personal significance, Raichlen grew up in the Pikesville area, though he now lives in Miami. He recalled spending summers at Camp Milldale, which was located on Pearlstone\u2019s current campus.\u201cFor me it was a nice homecoming, to come back to the city where I grew up,\u201d Raichlen said.Some of the places Raichlen has traveled to before in the name of barbecue include southern Arizona, West Virginia and northern Florida, places not known for their Jewish communities. So he was glad for the chance to film his program in a region with a sizable Jewish population.\u201cTo be in a location where there was a mezuzah on the door of every room in every building, to take our meals in a dining room that was kosher \u2026 it was a wonderful reconnection with a Jewishness that is often not present in the world of barbecue,\u201d he said.Raichlen\u2019s path to a barbecue television program started when he wrote \u201cThe Barbecue! Bible: More than 500 Great Grilling Recipes from Around the World.\u201d He has written other books on barbecuing as well.\u201cShortly after [writing \u201cThe Barbecue! Bible\u201d], I sat down one night and I made a list of all the things I wanted to accomplish with barbecue,\u201d Raichlen said.One of those goals was to start a barbecue television show. He hoped such a program could cut through a culinary tradition weighed down by a lot of \u201csuperstition, and not much method to the madness, as it were,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show people my method, and how I understand the process.\u201d Teaming up with MPT, \u201cProject Fire\u201d is the fourth television series he\u2019s done.Raichlen \u201cis a well-known expert in the barbecue world,\u201d said Eve Wachhaus, Pearlstone\u2019s deputy director. \u201cAnd \u2018Project Fire\u2019 is a wonderful TV show that inspires millions of viewers to expand their knowledge all about barbecue.\u201dWachhaus and Jakir Manela, Pearlstone\u2019s executive director, make appearances in episodes of the program.\u201cIn the episode I do,\u201d Wachhaus said, \u201cwe use Baltimore specialty rockfish, and we grill it with fresh figs and shallots straight off of our land.\u201dFilming at Pearlstone involved extensive testing for coronavirus and temperature checks, Raichlen said. The team also wore face masks, though Raichlen did not wear one when he was being filmed.Raichlen was proud that not a single person caught COVID-19 during production.Though he may not fit into the traditional mold that people may affiliate with barbecue, Raichlen feels that he brings an \u201cintellectual, cultural, anthropological approach to barbecue.\u201d", "url": "https://www.jewishtimes.com/pikesville-native-returns-home-to-film-cooking-show/", "date": "2021-05-05T14:39:21-04:00", "access_date": "2021-05-07T22:19:36.217609"}
