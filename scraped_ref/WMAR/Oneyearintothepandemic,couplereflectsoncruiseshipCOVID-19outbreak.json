{"title": "One year into the pandemic, couple reflects on cruise ship COVID-19 outbreak", "body": "\u201cCompared to a year ago, we\u2019re better than we were,\" said Rebecca Frasure.After what Kent and Rebecca Frasure have been through, you might be surprised to hear that they want to go on a cruise again.\u201cWe will definitely will,\" Kent Frasure said.Few vacations will live on in history like theirs that started in January 2020.\u201cAs time goes on, the experience, it almost doesn\u2019t feel like it really happened,\" Rebecca said.The Frasures were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship saw COVID-19 spread to more than 700 people on board, and Rebecca was among them.Recent Stories from wmar2news.com\u201cI had been feeling a little under the weather in the days prior to finding out,\" she recalled. \"But I didn\u2019t attribute it to having coronavirus at all.\u201dShe spent close to a month in a Japanese hospital, alone.\u201cI don\u2019t speak the language I have no idea what they\u2019re going to tell me,\" Rebecca said.This happened more than a month before COVID-19 had become widespread in the U.S. and became a global pandemic.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a big deal to us at this point. We thought it was just a small thing that was contained to mainland China,\" Kent said.Kent and the rest of the passengers were kept aboard the ship docked off the coast of Japan.He spent 17 days quarantined in his room.\u201cYou were stuck in your room. They did let us out in small groups to walk around the outside, for about an hour but that was it,\" Kent said.Even though the virus continued to infect others on board, Kent never tested positive.\"It\u2019s one of those mysteries that I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t get it,\" Kent said.After 28 days in the hospital, Rebecca tested negative for the coronavirus twice. The Frasures returned home to Oregon, where both COVID-19 and word of their trip had spread.\u201cI got some nasty grams on social media,\" Rebecca said. \"I had people from my community here saying, \u2018Don\u2019t come home from Japan. We don\u2019t want you here,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Seriously? First of all, this is beyond my control. I didn\u2019t ask to get this virus. I was just going on vacation like anyone would.\u2019\u201dFew businesses have been hit by the pandemic as hard as those in the .The Frasures hope when voyages begin again, the lessons of the Diamond Princess will be aboard.\u201cYou can\u2019t put people through a quarantine like that in a contaminated environment. You have to be able to respond quicker and more effectively,\" Kent said.The Frasures will tell their story in an upcoming HBO Max documentary called \"The Last Cruise.\"\u201cWe need to be prepared for something like this to happen again because it\u2019s inevitable even if it\u2019s 100 years from now, it\u2019s going to happen again,\" Rebecca said.If the Frasures can take anything from the last year, it\u2019s now having one of the more unique stories about how life has changed in the pandemic.Rebecca will forever be known as one of the first Americans to get COVID-19 and survive.\u201cIt is strange to know I am kind of part of history. Never thought I would have 15 minutes of fame, let alone like this, so it\u2019s very weird,\" she said.While it may be hard to sum up all that has happened in the past 12 months, they say it\u2019s important to remember just how unique it is, which is why they say their last cruise won\u2019t be their final one.\u201cWe really love cruising, and cruising just gets in your blood. If you talk to most people on the ship, the vast majority would say they would take another cruise,\" Kent said.", "url": "https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national-politics/the-race/one-year-into-the-pandemic-couple-reflects-on-cruise-ship-covid-19-outbreak", "date": " 12:21 PM, Mar 12, 2021 ", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:48:03.812647"}
