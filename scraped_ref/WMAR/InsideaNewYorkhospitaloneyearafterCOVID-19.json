{"title": "Inside a New York hospital one year after COVID-19", "body": "LONG ISLAND, NY. \u2014 For nearly seven decades, this hospital has been a home for healing, but in the last year, the halls of the  have seen enough loss and heartbreak for seven lifetimes.\"This has just continued day after day, week after week, month after month, and quite frankly, although we're all proud of the work we did, it has taken a toll on all of us, because it has been a long, long dragged-out episode,\u201d said Dr. Mark Jarrett, the chief quality officer, senior vice president and deputy chief medical officer for Northwell Health.Dr. Jarrett said this has been unlike anything he\u2019s ever lived through. Recent Stories from wmar2news.com\u201cIt was unit after unit, with people asleep, intubated on multiple medications, and not knowing whether how many would live and how many would die,\u201d he said.In New York, there have been nearly 50,000 deaths in just twelve months, surpassing the more than 40,000 who usually die from the biggest killer there: heart disease.In just one year, the city that never sleeps was taken out by a virus.\u201cIt was horrible to be in that epicenter,\u201d said Dr. Jarrett.Dr. Jarrett tried to prepare his team for a crisis, but for emergency room physician Dr. Frederick Davis, no preparation could be enough.\u201cWe didn't know what to do, and we didn't know when it was going to end,\u201d said Dr. Davis.In March of 2020, the emergency department prepared one of its six units for COVID-19 patients, but that plan was quickly thrown out, and within weeks, patients were spilling into the lobby for treatment. The hospital was packed with more patients than it had ever seen before.\u201cIt just skyrocketed,\u201d said Dr. Davis.\u201cWe always had enough resources, but every night we went to sleep hoping that it wouldn't get any worse,\u201d said Dr. Jarrett.The doctors and nurses inside the Northwell Health Long Island Jewish Medical Center lost patients every single day.\u201cI know on the news it's reported as just, as just numbers, but these were people. They had family members. Every life lost touched someone,\u201d said Dr. Davis.For Dr. Davis, it was hard to work in the face of so much death. \u201cBeing in this field, we want to help people, and it was the only thing we could do is come the next day to work after a really tough day,\u201d said Dr. Davis. \u201cIt allowed us to at least hold another hand and allowed another loved one to talk to a family member.\u201dBut, each interaction with a COVID-19 patient left Dr. Davis thinking of his own family.\u201cTo possibly get infected and then obviously be at home with your family was always something in the back of our minds,\u201d said Dr. Davis.For Dr. Davis and his wife, who is also an emergency room doctor, the toughest part was staying away from their young son.\u201cHe'd come running and want to greet you, and you'd have to be like no stay away,\u201d said Davis. \"To the point where it sometimes, you know, he'd be crying.\u201dHe\u2019s thankful those precious hugs were his biggest loss. He watched many of his colleagues lose more.\u201cThis becomes your second family, and to see them not only struggle through work but then to also see them suffer from losing one of their own, it's unbearable,\u201d said Dr. Davis.Along with the irreplaceable cost of life also comes the cost to our healthcare system.\u201cThe lost revenue for Northwell, our whole health system, which is 23 hospitals, was probably over a billion and probably closer to $1.5 billion,\u201d said Dr. Jarrett.For this hospital, losing money hurts the patients and community more than anything.\u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018well you don't make a profit this year, big deal,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jarrett. \u201cThat's where we get the money to build a new project. That's where how we can build a new ICU. That's how we can build a new transplant program.\"All those projects are now pushed years away, but it is a cost Dr. Jarrett would pay again and again.\u201cOur job is to take care of patients and not really worry about the finances,\u201d he said.Finally, the emotional and financial burden is starting to lift with the vaccinations that started at Northwell Health.With this shred of progress, comes community.\u201cIt's like 9/11,\u201d said Dr. Jarrett. \u201cEverybody got together.\u201d And it will take a community to see this crisis end. With each shot, hope is gasping for air, fighting to see life after the pandemic.\u201cOne of the things that we really have to appreciate is how far we've come in a year,\u201d said Dr. Davis. \u201cEvery single aspect of life has been affected by this. We're trying to work together to really make sure that this becomes something of the past.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national-politics/the-race/inside-a-new-york-hospital-one-year-after-covid-19", "date": " 11:38 AM, Mar 12, 2021 ", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:47:57.620675"}
