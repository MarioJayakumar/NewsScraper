Yet, the real history lives on in the stories behind these pictures.\u201cI have vivid memories just right down the street here,\u201d said Sharon Maxwell, pointing at an empty lot behind her, reminiscing on her childhood neighborhood. The lot was once home to stores, businesses and family dwellings.\u201cEverything was just sort of like a roaring 20s, but in the 80s and in the 70s,\u201d she said.Recent Stories from wmar2news.comIt\u2019s the stories of hardworking families that made the Portland neighborhood thrive for decades. It became a hub for Black culture and community, in a district named Albina.\u201cThis predominantly was, I would say, 80% African-American,\u201d said Maxwell of her community.That makeup was no accident. In the 1920s, red lines drawn on a city map would dictate where people of color could live, buy property or get a bank loan, relegating the black community to Albina.Countless home deeds document the push to keep Black families out of Portland\u2019s downtown.That\u2019s how Sharon Maxwell\u2019s family ended up there. \u201cThey were dirt poor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were redlined to this area, and they did the best they could to survive,\u201d said Maxwell.Sharon\u2019s family lived just blocks from Paul Knauls Jr. Both grew up walking different lives down the same streets.\u201cMy father moved here in 1963,\u201d said Knauls Jr. \u201cHe was there to integrate Fairchild Air Force Base from Arkansas, and he always knew he wanted to be in business for himself.\u201dKnauls worked alongside his parents to build several successful Black-owned businesses. \u201cThe dollar stayed in the neighborhood at that time,\u201d said Knauls Jr.But that once successful ecosystem looks different now: Paul\u2019s businesses are gone. The last one just closed last year. It was a hair salon his parents started decades ago.A few streets over, Sharon\u2019s childhood home was demolished.\u201cTo see a lot of that just as memories, it kind of breaks my heart and it breaks the heart of the community,\u201d said Sharon.\u201cEveryone knew each other,\u201d said Knauls Jr. \u201cEveryone looked out for each other. Gentrification destroyed the community connection.\u201dIn the 1960s and 70s, thousands of African Americans in Albina were pushed from their homes through eminent domain with nowhere to go. A freeway replaced much of the neighborhood.New housing was promised, but was never built.\u201cIt's almost like the community is grieving,\u201d said Maxwell. \u201cWe're all grieving, you know, because we're losing that which we\u2019re familiar with, the people that we know.\u201d\u201cBy the time it was over, it was over 3,000 homes that Black people lived in that were gone,\u201d said Knauls Jr. \u201cSo, they were displaced. Along with that came all of the businesses.\u201dDevelopers and the City of Portland stepped in for urban renewal efforts, but to many families there, the projects made no impact.\u201cIt was painful,\u201d said Knauls Jr. \u201cThe buildings were so high there was no sun coming in, and people looked at you like you were a foreigner in your own neighborhood. That's what happened with gentrification.\u201dToday, new apartments sit in places Sharon and Paul remembered fondly.\u201cWe're living in one of the most white cities in America,\u201d said Maxwell. \u201cThey say they're offering affordable housing, but that is not the case. I mean, everybody that I know is like \u2018I can't afford to live there,\u2019\u201d she said.That\u2019s why these two are part of a project to bring back affordable housing and Black businesses to Albina.Sharon is developing plans for a corner to revitalize what was once here. She is one of few Black contractors and her company, , is working to make a positive impact on the neighborhood she holds so close to her heart.\u201cIt's a wealth creation for the African American community,\u201d said Maxwell of this new effort to bring back Albina to the hub for culture and community it once was.Paul is about to open a new business too, just a block from his family\u2019s salon. He sold his salon to a young Black entrepreneur, hoping to keep Black-owned business alive in Albina.\u201cWe're trying to continue that legacy,\u201d said Knauls Jr. of honoring the legacy his father started decades ago.It's a legacy of equality and opportunity the City of Portland is also getting behind, a partnership giving both Paul and Sharon hope.\u201cOne thing about Black folks, we overcome, we always have,\u201d said Knauls Jr. \u201cThe tide is changing again, and I honestly believe in my heart of hearts it's moving our way.\u201dWith hope, the rebirth of a community where all voices are lifted up, and where success is shared is becoming more of a reality each passing day.", "url": "https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national-politics/the-race/black-business-owners-fight-to-restore-culture-in-portlands-historic-albina-neighborhood", "date": " 11:00 AM, Feb 26, 2021 ", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:47:56.080490"}
