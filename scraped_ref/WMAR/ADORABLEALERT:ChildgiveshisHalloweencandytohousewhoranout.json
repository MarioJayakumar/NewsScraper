{"title": "ADORABLE ALERT: Child gives his Halloween candy to house who ran out", "body": "It really doesn't get more pure and sweet than this. A video captured by a nest camera shows a young vampire walking up to a house to collect his treats on Halloween. But there was one problem... the house had run out of candy! You hear the kid say, \"Oh no, there is not more candy!\" but it's what he does next that is capturing hearts across the nation. Instead of being disappointed and throwing a fit, the young boy takes candy from his own bag and puts it into the bowl so others who come will be able to get some. His selfless act shows that in a world of bad news... there is still some good and hope out there.
