Crawford fractured her foot, and just hours after she got out of surgery, she got a call from  she will never forget.\u201cThere's no script for it,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cI've been coaching a really long time. It was not something we could prepare for.\u201dCOVID-19 ended their tournament run, their season, and four seniors\u2019 collegiate careers.\u201cIt definitely was just heartbreak,\u201d said Crawford.\u201cFrom my heart, you know, I felt bad for them. I really did,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cAs an athlete, you want to finish your career on your own terms. You do want to finish on the court.\u201dMid-March in 2020, nearly all sports shut down. Professional seasons were canceled, collegiate tournaments were canceled, no athlete was unscathed.For the women on the basketball team at Penn, they were hoping this season would be better, but 2021 proved a repeat. The Ivy League announced the 2021 season was canceled, too.\u201cGrief and loss is the best way to put it,\u201d said Crawford. \u201cI think that more than anything, I felt like I had so much to give, not only on the court but also to my teammates.\u201dWithout the 2021 season to prepare for, Crawford said it was harder to recover from her injury.\u201cAll those hard days where I felt like, \u2018I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can get back to basketball at all.' I definitely used the season as a motivation. I called my mom, and I was like, \u2018Mom, I don't know what I'm doing, I feel super lost,'\u201d she said.But her mom and her first coach assured her of one thing: the lessons she\u2019s learned on the court don\u2019t vanish when she stops playing.\u201cSports are kind of a model for life, and while this is such an unprecedented time, I feel like we've all learned so many key life lessons from being in such an untimely pandemic. I think that, while there is so many negatives to find, I think that my approach to this has been finding the positives and being grateful for every moment and being able to savor and enjoy every moment I've had on the court with my team,\u201d said Crawford.Even now, she still has one more chance to hit the court. Universities across the country have extended eligibility for all seniors for one more year. It\u2019s a decision Crawford hasn\u2019t made for sure just yet.\u201cIt's so hard to walk away being like, \u2018There's another year I could have gave.\u2019 I think that it's good for it to look back and say, \u2018Did you give everything you could in the time that you were able to do?\u2019 I felt like, for me, in the time that I was allowed, I gave everything that I could to my team.\u201dShe is still practicing with her team until graduation this May, just in case she chooses to stay. If she does, she\u2019ll be with a team Coach McLaughlin says is stronger than ever.\u201cWe're out here working out now, and we don't have a game for another seven or eight months because the love of the sport. When we\u2019re ready to play again, they\u2019ll be better for it,\u201d he said.A better team after learning that a frustrating time is not wasted time and that no virus can destroy the will to play on.", "url": "https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national-politics/the-race/college-athletes-face-an-uncertain-future-a-year-into-the-pandemic", "date": " 11:43 AM, Mar 12, 2021 ", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:48:03.427389"}
