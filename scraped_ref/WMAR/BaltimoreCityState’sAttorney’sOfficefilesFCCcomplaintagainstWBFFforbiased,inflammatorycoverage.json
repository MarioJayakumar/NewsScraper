Specifically the content distributed to the public about the SAO and its lead prosecutor, State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby.Under the FCC\u2019s rules, \u201c[b]roadcasters may not intentionally distort the news,\u201d and \u201crigging or slanting the news is [deemed] a most heinous act against the public interest.\u201d Given that FCC guidance, an investigation into the persistent and slanted broadcasts of WBFF against the SAO and the State\u2019s Attorney would prove that the WBFF administrators are guilty of such \u201cheinous act[s].\"\"In my capacity at the States Attorney\u2019s Office, I have noted that the news coverage of the WBFF persistently follows a disconcerting and dangerous pattern: beginning with a slanted, rigged, misleading, or inflammatory headline; followed by a conspiracy theory; and supported with guest commentary from disgruntled ex-employees or political opponents that lend false credibility to their biased coverage or omission of facts. Utilizing this pattern of practice in their broadcasts, citizens are not only consistently misinformed about the basis and intent of prosecutorial policies, additionally the merit of criminal convictions are distorted to detract from the public good championed by prosecutors. Most disturbingly, there appears to be an intentional crusade against State\u2019s Attorney Mosby, which given today\u2019s politically charged and divisive environment, is extremely dangerous,\" said SAO Director of Communications, Zy Richardson.To read the full letter, .
