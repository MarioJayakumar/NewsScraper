Its bigger than just a box,\u201d added Ms. Gavvin.The Door is located in the 219N Chester Street in Baltimore and open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.", "url": "https://www.wmar2news.com/news/local-news/local-organization-distributes-6-million-meals-to-east-baltimore-residents", "date": " 6:38 PM, May 06, 2021 ", "access_date": "2021-05-07T20:47:12.089558"}
