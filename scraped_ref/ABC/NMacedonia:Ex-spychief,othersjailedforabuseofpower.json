Judges ruled that the purchase of the equipment was handled through an intermediary company and cost the state much more than if it had been done direct from the manufacturer.The court decision also ordered the defendants to jointly pay a total of 813,000 euros ($969,000) in damages.In February, Mijalkov was also sentenced to 12 years in prison as a lead organizer of a wiretapping scandal that broke in 2016 after it emerged that 20,000 people \u2014 including opposition politicians, judges, and journalists \u2014 were targeted.Gruevski fled to Hungary in 2018 to avoid serving a two-year jail sentence for involvement in a corruption scandal.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/macedonia-spy-chief-jailed-abuse-power-77045012", "date": "April 13, 2021, 11:10 AM"}
