Classes will resume at high schools and universities. Schools for younger children are already open, as are caf\u00e9 and restaurant esplanades.After becoming the world's worst-hit country by size of population in January, Portugal has seen the pandemic ebb significantly during a lockdown that authorities began loosening four weeks ago.The country\u2019s pandemic situation \u201cis very much under control,\u201d Ricardo Mexia, head of Portugal\u2019s National Association of Public Health Doctors, said Friday.Portugal, he told the Associated Press, is reaping the fruit of a lockdown that began in mid-January and \u201cwent on probably a bit longer than was strictly necessary.\u201dThe virus incidence rate per 100,000 population over 14 days -- a key pandemic metric -- stands at 68. At the end of January, it was 1,628.Meanwhile, the number of hospitalized virus patients has fallen to manageable levels. The intensive care units in the country of 10.3 million people were treating more than 900 patients in early February, but now are looking after 101.On Thursday, there were no COVID-19 deaths in Lisbon, the capital, for the first time since August. Portugal on Friday officially reported 553 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths nationwide.Part of the reason for that, apart from the lockdown, is that Portugal avoided imported cases with flight restrictions that for weeks virtually banned arrivals from other European Union countries. It also closed the border with neighboring Spain.Mexia, the doctors\u2019 association chief, said Portugal\u2019s fate in coming weeks depends on how careful residents are about wearing masks and keeping their distance from each other, how quickly authorities spring into action if an outbreak is detected, and how rapidly vaccinations are rolled out.A supply shortage has delayed Portugal\u2019s vaccination plan, like it has in the rest of the EU. Around 6.5% of the population is fully inoculated, slightly below the EU average.Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa warned late Thursday that the country could reverse gear and go back into lockdown if cases start to rise again. The requirement to wear masks and abide by social distancing rules remain in place, Costa said, as does a mandatory work-from-home order.In the outskirts of Lisbon, many people basked in the spring sunshine on restaurant esplanades Friday.\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Maria Ferreira, a 56-year-old company manager, said of the latest easing of restrictions as she ate lunch. \u201cWe have to stay positive -- but also be careful,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/portugal-reaps-benefits-prolonged-covid-19-lockdown-77117230", "date": "April 16, 2021, 10:55 AM"}
