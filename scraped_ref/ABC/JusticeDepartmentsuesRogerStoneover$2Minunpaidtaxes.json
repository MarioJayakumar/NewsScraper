It alleges the couple underpaid their income tax by more than $1.5 million from 2007 until 2011 and separately alleges Stone also owes more than $400,000 for not fully paying his tax bill in 2018.The suit alleges that the couple used a commercial entity known as Drake Ventures to \u201cshield their personal income from enforced collection\u201d and to fund a \u201clavish lifestyle.\u201d\u201cDespite notice and demand for payment, Roger and Nydia Stone have failed and refused to pay the entire amount of the liabilities,\u201d the lawsuit says.Stone, a longtime confidant of the former president's, calls the lawsuit \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201dStone was charged by the Justice Department in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and convicted at trial of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 . Trump later commuted Stone's sentence and pardoned him.Stone boasted during the 2016 campaign that he was in contact with  founder Julian Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to release more than 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee. But Stone denied any wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated.\u201cThe Internal Revenue Service is well aware of the fact that my three-year battle for freedom against the corrupted Mueller investigation has left me destitute,\u201d Stone told The Associated Press. \u201cThey\u2019re well aware that I have no assets and that their lawsuit is politically motivated. It\u2019s particularly interesting that my tax attorneys were not told of this action, filed at close of business on a Friday. The American people will learn, in court, that I am on the verge of bankruptcy and that there are no assets for the government to take.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/justice-department-sues-roger-stone-2m-unpaid-taxes-77128445", "date": "April 16, 2021, 7:37 PM"}
