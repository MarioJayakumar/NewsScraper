No, no, this is a voting rights question.\u201dThe ADL argued in a reply sent Monday to Murdoch that Carlson used white-supremacist language even if he claimed he didn't.\u201cMr. Carlson\u2019s attempt to at first dismiss this theory, while in the very next breath endorsing it under cover of \u2018a voting rights question,\u2019 does not give him free license to invoke a white supremacist trope,\u201d wrote ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt.The replacement conspiracy theory holds that people of color are replacing white people in the West, enabled by Jews and progressive politicians.During a guest appearance Thursday on \u201cFox News Primetime,\" Carlson \u201cembraced a foundational theory of white supremacy,\" the ADL said.During the show, Carlson said \u201cthe left and all the little gatekeepers on  become literally hysterical if you use the term \u2018replacement,\u2019 if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate of voters now casting ballots with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World.\" He added that he had \u201cless political power because they are importing a brand new electorate.\u201dThe ADL also listed numerous instances Carlson has used anti-immigrant language in the past, including blaming  for making the U.S. \u201cpoorer, and dirtier, and more divided,\" and questioned whether white supremacy was real.Murdoch noted in his letter that the ADL had once honored his father, Rupert Murdoch, with a leadership award. The ADL's Greenblatt replied that the award was granted \u201cover a decade ago, but let me be clear that we would not do so today, and it does not absolve you, him, the network, or its board from the moral failure of not taking action against Mr. Carlson.\u201dA Fox spokesperson declined to comment on the ADL's Monday letter.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/fox-stands-tucker-carlson-adl-urges-firing-77031125", "date": "April 12, 2021, 6:25 PM"}
