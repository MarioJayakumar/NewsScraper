Not just to honor him, but to support , who lost her husband of 73 years.The mix included children, seniors, Sikhs and the children of African immigrants. A cross-section of British society and admirers from abroad descended on Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle on Saturday. They laid bouquets at the gates, offered prayers or just paused for a moment of reflection as they remembered a man who dedicated much of his life to public service.Mourners talked about Philip\u2019s work with some 780 charities and organizations, particularly his Duke of Edinburgh Award, which seeks to build confidence and resilience in young people. But they also recalled his role as the consummate royal consort, supporting the queen at thousands of public engagements and state visits.\u201cWe had a really hard year all of us and there\u2019s people uniting in a very special moment,'' said Carolina Przeniewska, originally from Poland, who came to Buckingham Place with her 5-year-old daughter Grace. \u201cSo I wanted her to see it and I wanted to pay respect.\u201dAt Buckingham Palace, the queen\u2019s London residence, well-wishers braved a chilly, gray day to line up and snake their way past the black iron gates, where tourists normally wait to watch the changing of the guard. People were allowed to approach the gates one at a time to lay their tributes as police tried to control the crowd amid Britain's  restrictions.The crowd was smaller at Windsor Castle, west of the capital, where a steady stream of mourners quietly approached the gates to leave bright spring bouquets on a strip of lawn.People want to show their respect for both Philip and the queen, who turns 95 this month and will celebrate 70 years on the throne next year, said Nick Bullen, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV.\u201cIf the queen wasn\u2019t already loved enough, this is just going to move it to another level now,\u2019\u2019 Bullen said. \u201cThis is a woman who\u2019s going to bury her husband and then in a matter of days later be celebrating her birthday and stepping into her platinum jubilee year. \u2026 So I think people will just be rallying around the queen as much as they will the Duke of Edinburgh.\u201dPhilip, the son of a Greek prince, and the future queen first met as teenagers. They were married in 1947 when she was 21 and he was a 26-year-old naval officer.Elizabeth became queen when her father died in 1952. At her coronation, Philip swore to be his wife\u2019s \u201cliege man of life and limb\u201d and settled into a life of supporting the monarch.Philip retired from public life in 2017. At the time, he had conducted more than 22,000 public engagements on his own, given 5,496 speeches and made 637 solo trips abroad, in addition to countless more appearances by the queen\u2019s side.\u201cHe was a hero to me because he was the man I could look up to,\u201d Nurtr Omar, a 20-year-old who was born in Somalia and now lives in Britain, said outside Buckingham Palace. \u201cHe showed me what I can achieve with my life, whether you are royal or not. You need to make hard work to achieve what you want to.\u201dThe floral tributes grew throughout the day, even after the Royal Family on Friday asked people not to visit royal residences to pay their respects due to public  concerns. Instead of flowers, the family asked people to consider making donations to charity.But for Windsor resident Billy Dohil, the day was about history. He took his children to the castle so they could be part of it.\u201cAs they grow up, we\u2019ll remember this,\u201d Dohil, 39, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll remember the royal family and (it) will be part of their life. So we wanted to come here to pay our respects. My oldest son \u2014 five years old \u2014 wanted to bring some flowers and just put it down himself.\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press Writers James Brooks and Tom Rayner contributed.\u2014\u2014\u2014For AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip go to         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/bouquet-bearing-public-honors-philip-ignoring-covid-warning-76995774", "date": "April 10, 2021, 2:46 PM"}
