The 10-kilogram (22-pound) rover will carry two high-resolution cameras, a microscopic camera, a thermal imagery camera, a probe and other devices.\u201cOur mission through scientific endeavours such as the Emirates Lunar Mission is to keep the UAE flag flying high and be at the forefront of countries contributing to scientific achievements that will change the face of humanity,\u201d said Yousuf Hamad Al-Shaibani, who heads the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center.The space center oversees the country's astronaut program, in which the first Emirati astronaut was sent to the International Space Station in 2019.The UAE has plans to develop the Middle East's most advanced commercial satellite to produce high-resolution satellite imagery. It has also set the ambitious goal of building a human colony on Mars by 2117.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/uae-sets-ambitious-timeline-launch-moon-rover-77065653", "date": "April 14, 2021, 9:34 AM"}
