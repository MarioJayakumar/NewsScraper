The ship was due to arrive Saturday in Dutch Sint Maarten.Dozens of foreigners toting luggage descended from tour buses and cars at the port terminal in Kingstown and patiently waited in a line that began in the parking lot and reached deep into the terminal.They included students from the Trinity School of Medicine along with stranded tourists, including families with young children in arms.\u201cAs of right now, we are being evacuated for our safety and to keep the island as safe as possible,\" said LLeah Ransai, a Canadian student at Trinity. \"Between the school, the government and the embassies of the US and Canada, we\u2019re being evacuated now.\u201dThe U.S. Embassy said those aboard would have to make their own travel arrangements home.It also noted in an official statement that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended against travel on cruise ships because the chance of getting COVID-19 and said people who had been in close contact with suspected COVID-19 cases were barred from the trip. All aboard were supposed to have a negative rapid antigen test taken within 24 hours of boarding.Meanwhile, thousands of locals were stuck n emergency shelters with no idea when they might be able to return home.Levi Lewis, 58, a retired public servant from the town of Fancy, said the eruption had left him trying to get by with practically nothing.\u201cI just reusing clothing cause i didn't walk with much,\" he said. \"Plus water is an issue, so I\u2019m trying to conserve it still.\u201d\u201cI want to go back home, or to whatever is left of it,\" he added.A few people, however, never left, defying evacuation orders.Raydon May, a bus conductor in his late 20s who stayed in Sandy Bay throughout the eruptions, said he had always planned to stay if the volcano erupted and was trying to protect properties in the community while making occasional trips outside the evacuation zone to pick up water and supplies.He said so much ash had fallen that the roofs of houses were collapsing under the weight.\u201cOne roof might get on like three truckloads of sand,\" he said. \u201cWe trying to help ... but we can\u2019t help everybody.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/blast-st-vincent-volcano-cruise-ship-helps-evacuees-77121098", "date": "April 16, 2021, 1:56 PM"}
