That  certainty, however, did not extend to neighboring Peru, where the presidential contest is headed to a runoff after none of the 18 candidates obtained more than 50% of the votes.The South American nations held elections Sunday under strict public  measures amid a surging  pandemic that has brought on new lockdowns and exacerbated a general sense of fatigue. Peru, which also elected a new Congress, reported its highest single-day COVID-19 death count just as voters headed to the polls.The victory of former banker Guillermo Lasso in  came after less than half of a percentage point put him ahead of another candidate and allowed him to claim a spot in Sunday\u2019s runoff. The result breaks off the country\u2019s years under the so-called Correismo, a movement labeled after former President Rafael Correa who governed Ecuador from 2007 through 2017, grew increasingly authoritarian in the latter years of his presidency and was sentenced to prison last year in a corruption scandal.Correa\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Andr\u00e9s Arauz, easily advanced to the contest to replace President Len\u00edn Moreno, who chose not to seek re-election. Moreno was also an ally of Correa but turned against him while in office. In the runoff, Lasso benefited from the discontent toward Correa and his allies, but he will have face a strong Correista bloc in congress.\u201cThe first action will be to put the economy in order, promote investment and generate employment so that all Ecuadorians do not emigrate, stay in Ecuador and achieve the dreams they want for their families here,\u201d Lasso said at a press conference Monday.He said his  policy is twofold, defending Ecuadorians abroad \u201cbut at the same time, also acting humanely with Venezuelans who have arrived in Ecuador. ... We cannot be so inconsistent in asking for a good treatment for Ecuadorians living abroad and mistreating foreigners living in Ecuador; we have to be coherent\u201d and will seek to work with the United Nations.Ecuador is among the countries that have seen an influx of Venezuelan immigrants who have left their troubled nation in search of better opportunities.Asked about his future international policy, Lasso said he will promote the broadest multilateralism as a democrat \u201cwith a project that seeks the well-being of the Ecuadorian people.\u201d\u201cThat definition of the left and right is a reductionism in disuse at the present time,\u201d he said.Elections officials have not officially declared a winner, but Arauz conceded the election Sunday and at least one head of state has congratulated Lasso on the outcome.Economist Nikhil Sanghani with the firm Capital Economics on Monday wrote that the divided National Assembly \u201cmay water down\u201d some of Lasso\u2019s policies, but that concerns over \u201ca shift towards interventionist policymaking under Arauz\u201d should give way to relief that left-wing populism did not prevail.\u201cThe more market-friendly Lasso looks set to maintain amicable relations with the (International Monetary Fund), and will probably focus on improving the public finances,\u201d Sanghani wrote. \u201c... Our best guess is that the new government will pursue more moderate fiscal austerity, which would stop the public debt-to-GDP ratio from spiralling higher, but equally would not push it down as the IMF expects.\u201dThe pandemic paralyzed 70% of businesses in Ecuador last year and brought the country\u2019s unemployment rate to almost 68%. The country already had been in an economic slowdown that began in 2015, largely driven by the drop in oil prices.Similarly, in Peru, the world\u2019s second largest copper producer, the economy spiraled downward when a lockdown of more than 100 days early in the pandemic left about 7 million people unemployed. But unlike in Ecuador, Sunday\u2019s elections did not bring any clarity about the country\u2019s future.Eighteen presidential hopefuls turned the election into a popularity contest in which an ultra-conservative candidate even addressed how he suppresses his sexual desires. But none obtained the more than 50% of support needed to avoid a June 6 runoff.Elections officials on Monday said leftist Pedro Castillo had 18.9% of support, with 90% of ballots processed. He was followed by opposition leader Keiko Fujimori at 13.2%, right-wing economist Hernando de Soto with 11.86% and ultra-conservative businessman Rafael L\u00f3pez Aliaga at 11.83%.The crowded presidential contest came months after the country\u2019s political chaos reached a new level in November, when three men were president in a single week after one was impeached by Congress over corruption allegations and protests forced his successor to resign in favor of the third.Simultaneously, the country has been among the hardest hit by COVID-19, with more than 1.6 million cases and over 54,600 deaths as of Sunday.Castillo, a rural teacher, has proposed rewriting Peru\u2019s constitution and deporting all immigrants living in the country illegally, a moved aimed at the wave of Venezuelans who have sought refuge from their home country\u2019s crisis. He also wants to nationalize the mining, oil and energy fields.The outcome may alarm investors.\u201cThis outcome is a surprise and may put Peruvian financial markets on the backfoot,\u201d Sanghani wrote. \u201cThe polls suggest that no presidential candidate received more than 20% of the vote, and the victor will face a divided congress. There is a risk that the fractured political system will hinder Peru\u2019s pandemic response.\u201dPeruvian officials on Sunday said COVID-19 killed 384 people a day earlier, the highest single-day death toll of the pandemic.Hospitals are at capacity and ill individuals are dying at home. Meanwhile, the vaccination campaign has seen meager progress and was snarled in a scandal in which wealthy and well-connected people, including a former president, were secretly inoculated ahead of everyone else.All former Peruvian presidents who governed since 1985 have been ensnared in corruption allegation, some imprisoned or arrested in their mansions. One died by suicide before police could arrest him.Fujimori is the daughter of the polarizing former President Alberto Fujimori. He is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and the killings of 25 people. She has promised to free her father should she win.Claudia Navas, a political, social and security risk analyst with the global firm Control Risks, said Peruvians overall do not trust politicians, with corruption being a key driver of the disillusionment toward the political system. She said the new congress will likely continue to exercise its impeachment authority to reinforce its own influence and block any initiative that threatens its own power.\u201cRegardless of who wins, we believe that the president is somewhat unlikely to complete his or her term in office because of the of the populist-type of stance of the Congress and the risk of political instability is likely to persist through the administration,\u201d Navas said.\u2014\u2014\u2014Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.
