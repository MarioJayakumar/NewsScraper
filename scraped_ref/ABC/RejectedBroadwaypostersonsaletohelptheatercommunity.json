Not for theatrical poster designer Frank Verlizzo \u2014 he hopes you'll put his on your wall.Verlizzo is          for such shows as \u201cCabaret,\u201d \u201cEquus\u201d and \u201cMatilda\u201d with all proceeds going to the aid organization Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.\u201cIt's exciting for me because it\u2019s work that I particularly loved that I didn\u2019t think anyone was ever going to see,\u201d says the artist. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of wonderful that they\u2019re now out in the world, for better or for worse.\u201dThe 16 posters included in the series \u2014 each goes for $399 with a frame \u2014 were either rejected, never pitched or part of a group of submissions that Verlizzo made that allowed only one winner.One highlight is an alternative poster for \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d Disney, of course, went for Verlizzo's stark animal mane stamp that has become iconic. But now people can mount an unpublished design of his which uses paw prints from King Mufasa and newborn Simba to illustrate both the past and the future.\u201cThere are a million reasons why a poster gets rejected for a show,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a room full of people. It\u2019s like one big beauty contest. Everybody has their favorites.\u201dThe offerings include an intriguing one for \u201cMatilda\u201d that uses letters of the alphabet to make up a graphic portrait of the imaginative heroine. Verlizzo created it for the Broadway run of the musical but producers decided to keep the previous West End campaign.Verlizzo, who designs under the moniker \u201cFraver\u201d \u2014 a combination of his two names \u2014 says opening his vault and helping fellow artists during the pandemic was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\u201cThe devastation in the theater industry was unbelievable. So many of my friends were unemployed instantly,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope it raises a lot of money.\u201dThe project is in partnership with          the global production platform that enables artists to sell their designs to customers anywhere in the world using a network of local producers, which means carbon emissions are minimized.Julie Ryland, who led the project for Gelato, said each poster takes you behind the creative process and in some ways celebrates the people who work on Broadway who often aren't seen.\u201cEach one has a story. And and I think we crave stories during this time. We crave creativity,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that wall art has become so popular. Customers are just craving art and things to put up on their walls and bring into their homes now that we can\u2019t access it in other ways.\u201dPosters play a key role in a show's life. Until word of mouth takes over, ad campaigns have to entice patrons to be willing to pay high ticket prices for something they may know little about.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the first thing anybody sees about any show. And the thing I like most about it is it\u2019s the thing that stays behind when the show\u2019s no longer around,\u201d Verlizzo says.The latest set \u2014 on top of a collection of his work, \u201cFraver By Design: 5 Decades of Theatre Poster Art from Broadway, Off-Broadway and Beyond,\u201d show Verlizzo's range, which includes everything from woodcuts to elaborate typography to stylized illustration.\u201cThis was a criticism I always came up against at school \u2014 \u2018You don\u2019t have a style. You don\u2019t have your own style,\u2019\u201d he says. \"It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, I like all sorts of things. I like wood cuts. I like illustration. I like graphic design.\u2019 I don\u2019t see why I have to tie myself down to any one particular look or style.\u201dTo make his posters, Verlizzo starts with a script and dreams up an image that can be shrunk down to the size of a postage stamp newspaper ad or blown up to be on a billboard.\u201cI read it quickly first and try to get visual impressions, which is really what I\u2019m reading it for,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s a theme that I see evolving that I think would be that I could express graphically.\u201dHe works so far ahead that often the script isn\u2019t finished yet and there have been no casting decisions yet. He tries to come up with something to \u201ccatch your eye or intrigue a possible audience member.\u201dIn addition to art for \"The Lion King,\" Verlizzo has made his mark on Broadway with hundreds of posters for such shows as \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d and \u201cSunday in the Park with George.\u201dHe has no hard feelings if his design isn't picked by producers. \u201cWhen I finally do get to the theater to see the show, I always understand why they made the choice they did. It always makes perfect sense to me,\u201d he says.\u2014\u2014\u2014Mark Kennedy is at         ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/rejected-broadway-posters-sale-theater-community-77167958", "date": "April 19, 2021, 1:21 PM"}
