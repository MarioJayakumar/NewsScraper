We all need to see what happens.\u201dChina is the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitter, followed by the United States. The two countries pump out nearly half of the fossil fuel fumes that are warming the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Their cooperation is key to the success of global efforts to curb climate change, but frayed ties over human rights, trade and China\u2019s territorial claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea have been threatening to undermine such efforts.Noting that China is the world\u2019s biggest coal user, Kerry said he and Chinese officials had a lot of discussions on how to accelerate a global energy transition. \u201cI have never shied away from expressing our views shared by many, many people that it is imperative to reduce coal, everywhere,\u201d he said.Su Wei, a member of the Chinese negotiation team, told state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday that a major accomplishment of the talks was \u201crestarting the dialogue and cooperation between China and the United States on climate change issues.\u201d Su said the two countries reached a consensus on key areas for future cooperation on climate issues.Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to the April 22-23 summit. The U.S. and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting carbon emissions ahead of or at the meeting, along with pledging financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.It\u2019s unclear how much Kerry\u2019s China visit would promote U.S.-China cooperation on climate issues.While Kerry was still in Shanghai, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng signaled Friday that China is unlikely to make any new pledges at next week\u2019s summit.\u201cFor a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,\u201d Le said         during an interview with The Associated Press in Beijing. \u201cSome countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.\u201dDuring a video meeting with German and French leaders Friday, Xi said that climate change \u201cshould not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers,\u201d the official Xinhua News Agency reported.On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said \u201cthe Chinese side is actively studying the matter.\u201dThe joint statement said the two countries \u201clook forward to\u201d next week\u2019s summit. Kerry said Sunday that \u201cwe very much hope that (Xi) will take part\u201d in the summit but it\u2019s up to China to make that decision.Biden, who has said that fighting global warming is among his highest priorities, had the United States rejoin the historic 2015 Paris climate accord in the first hours of his presidency, undoing the U.S. withdrawal ordered by his predecessor .Major emitters of greenhouse gases are preparing for the next U.N. climate summit taking place in Glasgow, U.K., in November. The summit aims to relaunch global efforts to keep rising global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) as agreed in the Paris accord.According to the U.S.-China statement, the two countries would enhance \u201ctheir respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.\u201dIt said both countries also intend to develop their respective long-term strategies before the Glasgow conference and take \u201cappropriate actions to maximize international investment and finance in support of\u201d the energy transition in developing countries.Xi announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aims to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030. In March, China\u2019s Communist Party pledged to reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years, in line with its goal for the previous five-year period. But environmentalists say China needs to do more.Biden has pledged the U.S. will switch to an emissions-free power sector within 14 years, and have an entirely emissions-free economy by 2050. Kerry is also pushing other nations to commit to carbon neutrality by then.\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/us-china-agree-cooperate-climate-crisis-urgency-77144807", "date": "April 18, 2021, 9:15 AM"}
