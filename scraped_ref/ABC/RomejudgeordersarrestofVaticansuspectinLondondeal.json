They noted in a statement that a         British judge recently dismantled much of the Vatican\u2019s case against Torzi in a related asset seizure ruling.Vatican prosecutors have accused Torzi of extorting the Holy See of 15 million euros ($17.8 million) to turn over ownership of a luxury London building in which the Vatican's secretariat of state was a majority shareholder. Neither he nor anyone else under investigation has been indicted.Torzi denies wrongdoing. Contracts show top Holy See officials signed off on Torzi\u2019s involvement in the deal, and even  knew about it and had met with Torzi.Cappiello\u2019s 15-page order cited evidence gathered by both Vatican prosecutors and Rome investigators, who say they uncovered evidence of false billing, tax evasion and money laundering when Torzi\u2019s cellphone, emails and  messages were seized by Vatican investigators last year.Torzi\u2019s lawyers said in a statement Monday that all  had been paid on the transactions cited by Cappiello and that they expected it would be thrown out.They noted that a British judge recently ruled that there was no reason to believe that Torzi benefited from criminal conduct as alleged by the Vatican and that the city state\u2019s prosecutors had overstated their case through \u201cappalling\u201d omissions and misrepresentations to the court.The Vatican had         arrested Torzi for 10 days in June last year after he came into the Vatican City State for questioning about his role in the London deal. The Vatican\u2019s secretariat of state had used Torzi as a middleman to exit an investment fund that controlled the London property so that the Holy See could buy the building outright.Vatican prosecutors have suffered a series of losses in foreign courts over the course of their investigation, which has          raised questions about the rights of the accused in the Vatican's criminal justice system. The search of a key suspect's Rome apartment was declared illegitimate and         an extradition request for an Italian was woman dropped  at the last minute after Italy's high court established she never should have been arrested in the first place.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/rome-judge-orders-arrest-vatican-suspect-london-deal-77024456", "date": "April 12, 2021, 1:04 PM"}
