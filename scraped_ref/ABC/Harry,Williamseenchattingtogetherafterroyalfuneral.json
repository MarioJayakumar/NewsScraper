They were seen chatting and walking together after the service concluded.It was the first time the brothers had been together in public since Harry stood down from royal duties and moved to the U.S. with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their son Archie in early 2020.Tensions between Harry, 36, and William, 38, came to the fore after Harry and Meghan gave a revealing interview to U.S. talk show host  last month. The couple portrayed the royal family as indifferent to Meghan\u2019s mental health struggles, and Harry described his relationship with William as \u201cspace at the moment.\u201dOn Saturday, William and Harry walked in silence on either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips, as they joined other senior royals in Philip\u2019s funeral procession. At one point Phillips fell behind slightly to allow the brothers to walk side by side \u2014 a visual echo of the moment the pair, as boys in 1997, walked behind the coffin of their mother Princess Diana in another royal funeral televised around the world.The brothers sat opposite each other in St. George's Chapel for the funeral, which was attended by only 30 people because of coronavirus restrictions. While William sat next to his wife Kate, Harry was on his own because Meghan is pregnant with their second child and was advised by her doctor not to make the long trip.Afterwards, Harry, William and Kate strolled together outside the chapel. Moments later, the brothers walked together alone while Kate spoke to Zara Tindall, another of Queen Elizabeth II's eight grandchildren who is William and Harry\u2019s cousin.Rumors of a rift between the brothers \u2014 William, the heir, and Harry, the \u201cspare\u201d \u2014 have rumbled at least since 2019. That's when Harry and Meghan separated from the Royal Foundation, originally set up as the brothers\u2019 joint charitable venture, to set up their own platform. That year, Harry said he loved his brother dearly but they were \u201con different paths\u201d and have \u201cgood days\u201d and \u201cbad days.\u201dMany believe that William was angered and hurt by Harry\u2019s decision to speak so publicly about the royal family's issues during the Winfrey interview. In one explosive allegation, they said a family member \u2014 not the queen or Philip \u2014 had expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about Archie's possible skin color before he was born. Meghan has a Black mother and a white father.Days after the interview aired, William insisted \"we are very much not a racist family,\u201d and said he had not spoken to Harry since the broadcast.It's unclear whether the passing of their grandfather will help the brothers heal their rift. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long Harry, who has been self-isolating in line with the U.K.'s coronavirus restrictions since arriving from California early this week, will stay in his home country.Saturday's funeral was limited to only 30 people, who all had to wear masks, sit in family bubbles and remain socially distanced in the same church that had hosted hundreds of people for Harry and Meghan's royal wedding in 2018. And Britain's continued coronavirus restrictions may limit how much opportunity the brothers will get to smooth over their differences.\u201cBecause of the restrictions of COVID, it\u2019s difficult to get down to decent conservations,\u201d said royal biographer Penny Junor. \u201cIt\u2019s probably quite difficult to sit down as they normally would over a beer and discuss things.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip at         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/harry-william-chatting-royal-funeral-77140301", "date": "April 17, 2021, 5:31 PM"}
