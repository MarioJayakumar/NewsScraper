We can make a better case politically at home if other countries are acting at the same level of ambition as the U.S.\u2033The 2030 goal, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is a key part of the Paris climate agreement, which Biden rejoined on his first day in office. It\u2019s also an important marker as Biden moves toward his ultimate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\u201cClearly the science demands at least 50%\u201d in reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Jake Schmidt, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.The 50% target \u201cis ambitious, but it is achievable,'' he said in an interview. It's also a good climate message, he said: \u201cPeople know what 50% means \u2014 it's half.''Whatever target Biden picks, the climate summit itself \u201cproves the U.S. is back in rejoining the international effort\u2033 to address climate change, said Larsen, now a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.The summit is \u201cthe starting gun for climate diplomacy\u201d after a four-year \u201chiatus\u201d under Trump, she said. John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has been pressing global leaders, including his counterpart in China, for commitments and alliances on climate efforts.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is falling behind China, the largest producer and exporter of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles.\u201cIf we don\u2019t catch up, America will miss the chance to shape the world\u2019s climate future in a way that reflects our interests and values, and we\u2019ll lose out on countless jobs for the American people,'' Blinken said Monday in a speech in Annapolis, Maryland.Nathaniel Keohane, another former Obama White House adviser and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said experts have coalesced around the need for the U.S. to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030.\u201cThe number has to start with 5,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe've done the math. We need at least 50%.''The 2030 target is just one in a sometimes overlapping set of goals that Biden has outlined on climate. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economywide by 2050.Biden's climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, acknowledged that the sheer volume of numbers can be confusing. At a forum last week, she and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg said climate activists should focus on actions in the next decade.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about 2050,'' said McCarthy, who is leading White House efforts to develop U.S. climate commitments for 2030.Bloomberg, 79, was even more blunt: 2050 \u201cis a good number for people who give speeches, but I don\u2019t know anyone giving those speeches who\u2019s going to be alive in 2050.''Some Republican lawmakers call the focus on reducing U.S. emissions counterproductive, saying Biden's plan would raise energy costs and kill American jobs while allowing Russia, China and other countries to increase greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cThe Biden administration will set punishing targets for the United States, while our adversaries keep the status quo. That won\u2019t solve climate change,'' said Sen. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee. The United States already leads the world in reducing carbon emissions, Barrasso said, adding that Biden should try to \u201cmake American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for consumers.\u201dSome on the left think Biden is not going far enough.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has called for a massive Green New Deal, said Biden deserves \u201ca lot of credit\u201d for his infrastructure plan's vision and scope, but said it falls far short of what is needed to meaningfully combat the climate crisis. She and her supporters are calling for at least $10 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to address climate change and other problems.McCarthy disputed the notion that Biden has backtracked from campaign promises to lead on climate.\u201cWe\u2019re always either doing too little or too much,'' she told reporters earlier this month. \u201cBut rest assured that the president put a (spending) number out here that he felt was not just defensible but required to meet this moment in time.''Much of the proposed spending to address climate change is included in Biden\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.If Republicans think less money should be spent on clean energy and infrastructure, McCarthy added, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have those conversations.\u201dMarcella Burke, a former Trump administration official who now is an energy lawyer in Houston, gives Biden an \u201cA-plus for enthusiasm\u201d on climate, but an incomplete on details. \u201cWe've had a lot of goals, but not a lot of strategy announced to get there,'' she said. \"So the jury is still out.''\u2014\u2014\u2014AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/biden-pressed-emissions-goal-climate-summit-nears-77158208", "date": "April 19, 2021, 6:10 PM"}
