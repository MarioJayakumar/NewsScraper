The identity of the victims had not been released by Sunday afternoon. KHOU reported that one was 69 and the other was 59.Tesla did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.Federal traffic-safety officials are investigating several Tesla crashes in which the vehicle's Autopilot function may have been used, including crashes in which cars drove under tractor-trailers.The company warns customers that its driver-assist system, called Autopilot, is not an autonomous-driving program, and that they must pay attention and be ready to take control of the vehicle. However, the National Transportation Safety Board said last year that the design of the system          allows drivers to avoid paying attention and fails to limit where Autopilot can be used.KPRC-TV reported that a brother-in-law of one of the victims said it took four hours to extinguish the blaze. Authorities said the vehicle\u2019s batteries repeatedly reignited, and Herman said that deputies called Tesla to ask how to put out the fire.
