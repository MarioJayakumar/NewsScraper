In , some politicians have called for an end to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with Russia.And over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron said that while dialogue with Russia is essential, \u201cclear red lines\u201d carrying possible sanctions must also be drawn with Moscow over Ukraine.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell already criticized the Kremlin for its arrest and treatment of Navalny on Sunday and insisted he should have access to medical professionals he trusts.\u201cAll in all, the relations with Russia, are not improving, but the contrary, the tension is increasing in different fronts,\u201d Borrell said in a statement ahead of Monday's meeting.At the same time the 27 foreign ministers will have a video conference with their Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba to underscore Western support for the government, amid escalating tensions in the country\u2019s east and a Russian troop buildup across the border.On Sunday, Kuleba asked for stronger Western backing, saying \u201cwords of support aren\u2019t enough.\u201d Kuleba spoke with his Baltic counterparts who are expected to back his call during Monday's meeting.\u201cWe call on Russia to withdraw their troops,\u201d said Borrell.More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. The EU has steadfastly opposed the annexation but has been unable to do anything about it.Efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled and violations of a shaky truce have become increasingly frequent in recent weeks across Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-foreign-ministers-talk-amid-uproar-ukraine-navalny-77159653", "date": "April 19, 2021, 5:45 AM"}
