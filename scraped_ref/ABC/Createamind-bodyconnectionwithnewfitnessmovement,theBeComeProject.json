Meyers demonstrates workout to help you feel confident and powerful With the stress of the pandemic, body image issues have been on the rise.For Maggi Apollon of Miami, she\u2019s felt it personally.\u201cI\u2019ve been on and off diets,\u201d Apollon told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI think I came from a thought that my body always needed to be fixed, that needed to be a certain way, and I started getting really frustrated.\u201dSo, Apollon turned to intuitive eating and incorporated the joyful movement with the Be.come project, a mind-body fitness program centered around how you think and feel.\u201cFor me, that was transformational,\u201d she said. \u201cI can be me, I can do movement for myself, not to be a certain weight, not to be a certain appearance.\u201dBe.come founder Bethany C. Meyers said their mission with the project is body-neutrality and to offer unique, adaptable routines each week for those of all shapes and sizes.\u201cYou may feel good about your body some days, and you may feel bad about your body some days, but every single day, you respect your body,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s that respect where we can really start to create a new relationship with ourselves.\u201dThe Be.come project is one of many fitness movements across the country focused on what\u2019s inside rather than out. As part of Be.come, the program also offers a mental check-in for attendees.\u201cWe check in with how we\u2019re feeling,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly powerful because it takes a moment before and after your movement to say, \u2018How am I feeling today?\u2019\u201dFor Apollon, Be.come has allowed her to break the cycle of feeling let down by body image and instead, creating a mind-body connection to feel happier and healthier. She\u2019s encouraging others to find ways to apply similar lessons to what she\u2019s learned with be.come and to practice gratitude toward your body.\u201cWho you are is enough and your weight is not your worth,\u201d she said. \u201cFind some movement, that helps you feel stronger.\u201dSee a demo from Bethany of a favorite Be.come movement below.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/create-mind-body-connection-fitness-movement-project/story?id=77084835", "date": "April 15, 2021, 8:49 AM"}
