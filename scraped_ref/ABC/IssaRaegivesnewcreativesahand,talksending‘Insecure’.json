I need the right person to see me and see my work\u2019 and I feel like I can deliver from there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then it was, \u2018I\u2019m broke as hell.\u2019 If I could just have a certain amount of money to help me continue to do my work, then I\u2019d be good.\u201dIt was a decade ago that the first episode of her viral webseries \u201cAwkward Black Girl\u201d launched. She ran out of money, then was saved by a  campaign.So Rae, now an aspiring entertainment mogul with a         reported new $40 million WarnerMedia deal, wants to lighten the load for others hoping to climb the entertainment ladder.She's teaming up with LIFEWTR, PepsiCo\u2019s bottled water product line, and its \u201cLife Unseen\u201d campaign. They\u2019re hoping to shed light on 20 up-and-coming creatives in fashion, film, music and visual art from underrepresented communities.Their content will be featured at LIFEWTR.com and their individual artwork will also be displayed on a collection of 20 bottles starting next month. There\u2019s also a #LifeUnseenContest on Instagram which includes a chance for five more artists to be mentored by Rae and provided $10,000 each for future projects.\u201cIt\u2019s always been a mission to make sure that people have a place within this industry,\u201d said the \u201cInsecure\u201d creator and star. \u201cIt\u2019s about opening the door, and even the talent that we selected, we hope that that will be their mission as well.\u201dThe campaign aligns with what Rae already does: extending her hand to pull others up. Industry colleagues and co-workers often sing her praises for offering opportunities in what\u2019s perceived as a ruthless industry. Last season on \u201cInsecure,\u201d she tapped several young directors to lead episodes, like rising filmmaker Thembi Banks and         Rae\u2019s own co-star, Jay Ellis.\u201cIf you have the opportunity to give people the chance that they\u2019re looking for, then why not provide that opportunity? I have nothing to lose and I have only things to gain by watching passionate people deliver,\u201d said Rae, who recently won the NAACP Image Award for outstanding actress in a comedy series.Rooting for others to succeed, especially Black people who have been historically underrepresented in Hollywood, has been Rae\u2019s mantra. Her viral         \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody Black\u201d  response during a 2017 Emmys red carpet interview was something she said off the cuff and is now found on T-shirts, stickers, pins and other trinkets.\u201cI still think about leaving the carpet that day and my publicist being like, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re everywhere!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018They didn\u2019t like the dress?'\" she said, with a huge belly laugh. \u201c\u2019Then she told me, \u2018Oh, no, everybody\u2019s saying this phrase.\u2019\"Rae's Hoorae production company is now focused on the final season of \u201cInsecure.\u201d Serving as co-creator, executive producer and lead, Rae says it\u2019s time to close this novel \u2014 even if the fans aren\u2019t ready.\u201cThat\u2019s like being mad that you\u2019re reaching the end of a book. And I understand that sentiment \u2014 it\u2019s a compliment that people want it to continue. But you bought this book and you saw the length of it, and we\u2019re at the end of it.\u201dBut does she feel pressure to end the show in a way that\u2019s pleasing to both her and her loyal viewers?\u201cI have no doubt that if people don\u2019t like the ending, they\u2019re going to make it clear to me and make it known for the rest of my life,\u201d she laughed. \u201cSo in that way, yes, there is pressure, but I\u2019m happy with where things are ending. I like stories ending.\u201dUp next for Rae is \u201cRap Sh(asterisk)t,\u201d a series loosely based off the firecracker female rap duo City Girls, as well as a remake to the cult classic \u201cSet It Off.\u201d She\u2019s also completed her first script for a movie she hopes to film soon. Hoorae is said to be juggling more than a dozen projects in various stages.With magazine cover shoots and glamourous red carpet looks, Rae is far from those early lean years despite still hustling like one. So what would she go back and tell that awkward Black girl?\u201cShe should not be afraid to dream big and to possibly dream even bigger,\u201d said Rae. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still going to be awkward, so just embrace it.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at twitter.com/garyghamilton", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/issa-rae-creatives-hand-talks-ending-insecure-77122534", "date": "April 16, 2021, 2:19 PM"}
