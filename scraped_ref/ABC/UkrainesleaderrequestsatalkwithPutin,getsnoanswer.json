More than 14,000 people have died in fighting in eastern Ukraine and efforts to negotiate a political settlement have stalled.\u201cThe Kremlin, of course, has the request to talk to Vladimir Putin. We haven't received a response so far and very much hope that it's not a refusal of dialogue,\u201d Iuliia Mendel, a spokeswoman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told The Associated Press. The request was lodged on March 26, when four Ukrainian troops were killed in a mortar attack in the east, she added.But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday he hasn't seen any requests from Zelenskyy \u201cin recent days.\u201dWestern and Ukrainian officials have raised concerns about increasingly frequent cease-fire violations in the conflict area.

These numbers are likely to grow as the troops \u201ckeep arriving,\" she said.During a call with Putin last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the removal of Russian troop reinforcements \"in order to achieve a de-escalation of the situation.\u201dMerkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that Germany has been following the Russian military buildup along the border with Ukraine very closely, adding it has been \"of great concern to us.\u201dThe Kremlin has maintained that Russia is free to deploy its troops wherever it wants on its territory and has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian military of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d along the line of control in the east and plans to retake control of the rebel regions by force. Kremlin officials charged that Kyiv's actions have threatened Russia\u2019s security, warning that Russia may intervene to protect Russian speakers in the east.Speaking on a trip to Egypt on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that \u201cthe current regime in Kyiv might resort to reckless actions in an attempt to restore its ratings.\u201dAmid the rising tensions, the United States has notified Turkey that two U.S. warships will sail to the Black Sea on April 14 and April 15 and stay there until May 4 and May 5.Russia long has bristled at Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO and its increasing military cooperation with the U.S. and its allies.Lavrov argued that while Russia was moving troops on its own territory, \"a question what the U.S. ships and servicemen taking part in NATO activities in Ukraine are doing thousands of kilometers away from its territory has remained unanswered.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Frank Jordans in Berlin and Sam Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-leaders-request-talk-putin-official-77020628", "date": "April 12, 2021, 8:30 PM"}
