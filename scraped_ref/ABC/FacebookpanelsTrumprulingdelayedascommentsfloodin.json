We will share more information soon.\u201dThe board said its decision would be announced \u201cin the coming weeks,\" without being more specific.Facebook set up the oversight panel to act as the ultimate referee on content decisions, amid furious criticism about its inability to respond to a tide of misinformation, hate speech and other harmful content. The board is empowered to make binding rulings on issues such as whether posts or ads violate the company\u2019s rules.The social media giant regularly takes down thousands of posts and accounts. Since it was launched in October, the board has received some 300,000 appeals from users over content decisions, but it's prioritizing cases that have the potential to affect many users around the world. It has overturned decisions in five of the seven cases it has ruled on so far.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/facebook-panels-trump-ruling-delayed-comments-flood-77125317", "date": "April 16, 2021, 4:30 PM"}
