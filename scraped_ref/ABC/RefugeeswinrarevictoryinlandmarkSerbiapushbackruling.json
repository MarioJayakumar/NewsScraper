Instead, they were ordered out near the country's border with Bulgaria in the middle of that night four years ago. In below-freezing temperatures and desperately in need of help, they had no choice but to head to Bulgaria \u2014 the country they had left just a day earlier.\u201cI will not forget it as long as I live,\u201d said Ahmadi, who was 17 at the time and now lives in Germany. \u201cEven after a period of good life and stability, one cannot forget the tough times.\u201dThe Serbian border police had engaged in a pushback, or collective expulsion, one of many such actions along the travel routes used by migrants and refugees trying to reach Western Europe. But unlike most such illegal deportations, the officers' actions in February 2017 resulted in the Afghan refugees winning an unprecedented legal victory in Serbia's highest court.The Balkan country's Constitutional Court ruled in December that the border control officers unlawfully deported the refugees and violated their rights. The court also ordered Serbian authorities to pay the 17 members of the group who brought the lawsuit 1,000 euros ($1,180) each in compensation.\u201cThe importance of this verdict is immense for Serbia,\u201d said Belgrade lawyer Nikola Kovacevic, who represented the refugees in the case. It sends a \u201cclear message to state authorities to harmonize their border practices with domestic and international law.\"The ruling is a rare official acknowledgment that countries in Europe conduct pushbacks in violation of European Union and international laws which ban forcibly returning people to other countries without looking into their individual circumstances or allowing them to apply for asylum.Although refugees and economic migrants passing through the Balkans regularly give accounts of the practice, authorities routinely deny that their agencies carry out pushbacks, which are difficult to prove and mostly go unpunished.Turned back and forth at various borders, people fleeing war and poverty spend months, if not years, on the road, exposed to harsh conditions and danger in the hands of         people-smugglers and human traffickers. Sometimes, refugees and migrants are sent back over two or three borders it had taken them months to cross.Human rights groups have called repeatedly for governments to uphold their responsibilities involving refugee rights and accused the European Union of turning a blind eye to the illegal activity taking place at its doorstep.The United Nations mission in Bosnia called this month for urgent action to halt pushbacks along EU member Croatia's border with Bosnia after a U.N. team encountered         50 men with wounds on their bodies who reported authorities pushed them back and took their possessions away when they tried to enter Croatia.According to the U.N. refugee agency's office in Serbia and its partners, 25,180 people were pushed back into Serbia from Croatia, Bosnia, Hungary and Romania last year.Kovacevic, the lawyer in Serbia, said collective expulsions became increasingly common after         the EU and Turkey  made a 2016 agreement intended to curb migration to Europe. More than a million people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia had streamed to the continent the year before. The agreement called for Turkey to control the flow of people departing its territory          in exchange for aid  for the large number of Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as other incentives.\u201cAll the borders have introduced the practice of systematic violations of the ban on collective expulsions,\u201d Kovacevic said. \u201cBut at least now in Serbia, this was officially confirmed, not by a non-government organization, local or foreign, but the highest authority for protection of human rights.\u201dTo hide any evidence of wrongdoing, border control officers routinely strip refugees of mobile phones or documents. In the case of Ahmadi and the others, a clear trace of evidence was left behind thanks to what Kovacevic said was the \u201cblatant arrogance\u201d of the Serbian police who \u201cthought they could do whatever they wanted.\"It started on Feb. 2, 2017, when 25 migrants, including nine children, were caught at the border with Bulgaria and brought to a nearby police station in Serbia. They were kept for hours in a basement room, then taken before a judge to face charges of illegally crossing the border. The judge, however, ruled that the group should be treated as refugees and taken to an asylum center.Ahmadi, who spoke to the AP from Germany through an interpreter, said he clearly remembers when the judge asked them if they wanted to stay in Serbia. He said he was happy they would finally have a place in the camp after traveling through Turkey and Bulgaria.Hours later, inside the border police van that was supposed to take them to the camp, Ahmadi realized something was wrong. When police abandoned them in the forest, \u201cI felt broken,\" he recalled. \u201cI thought about my family at home.\"In the pitch dark and freezing temperatures, the refugees headed on foot toward Bulgaria \u2014 and straight into the hands of border police in that country. They managed to phone an interpreter in Serbia, who alerted refugee rights activists in both Serbia and in Bulgaria.The refugees stayed in camps in Bulgaria, some for days and others longer, before making it back to Serbia again and later moving on toward Western Europe. The rights lawyers later collected documentation left behind by the Serbian court and the Bulgarian authorities, establishing a clear trace of events that helped build the case in the court.Four years later, Kovacevic is trying to establish contact with all the people from Afghanistan he represented; they are scattered in countries that also include France and Bosnia. Coronavirus lockdowns have made it more difficult to establish contact and arrange money transfers for the damages they won, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s taking a little longer, but we will get there,\u201d smiled Kovacevic.Ahmadi, who was granted asylum in Germany five months ago, said he plans to use the damages to help him and his wife start a new life in Europe. He is now taking German language lessons before looking for a job.\u201cThis compensation means a lot to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be able to buy a bed and a little something for our flat once we rent it.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s global migration coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/migration", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/refugees-win-rare-victory-serbia-landmark-pushback-ruling-77147427", "date": "April 18, 2021, 10:17 AM"}
