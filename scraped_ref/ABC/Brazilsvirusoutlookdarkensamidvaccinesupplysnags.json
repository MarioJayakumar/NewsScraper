It has recorded about 350,000 of the 2.9 million virus deaths worldwide, behind only the U.S. toll of over 560,000.Brazil's seven-day rolling average has increased to 2,820 deaths per day, compared with the global average of 10,608 per day, according to data through April 8 from Johns Hopkins University.The death toll is forecast to continue rising in the next two weeks to an average of nearly 3,500 per day before receding, according to the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.Public  experts blame President Jair Bolsonaro for refusing to enact strict measures to halt infections and for clashing with governors and mayors who did.Failure to control the spread has been compounded by the Health Ministry betting big on a single vaccine, AstraZeneca, then buying only one backup, the Chinese-manufactured CoronaVac, after supply problems emerged. Authorities ignored other producers and squandered opportunities until it was too late to get large quantities of vaccine for the first half of 2021.With extensive experience in successful, massive vaccination programs, Brazil should have known better, said Claudio Maierovitch, former head of Brazil\u2019s health regulator.\u201cThe big problem is that Brazil did not look for alternatives when it had the chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen several countries were placing their bets, signing contracts with different suppliers, the Brazilian government didn\u2019t even have vaccination on its agenda.\u201dFor months, Bolsonaro\u2019s administration ignored pleas to sign more than one contract for . The president publicly questioned the reliability of other shots and scoffed at contractual terms, suggesting that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine would have no legal recourse were they to transform into alligators. He insisted he wouldn\u2019t force anyone to get vaccinated and only recently said he might get a shot himself.Denise Garrett, vice president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute that advocates for expanding global vaccine access, said she despaired at the government strategy. Brazil has been far and away Latin America\u2019s immunization front-runner, so much so that she hadn\u2019t seen it in the same league as the region\u2019s other countries.Given the problems in vaccine development and distribution, \u201cit\u2019s definitely not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket,\u201d she said from Washington.Stalled supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine in January amid pressure for Brazil to begin its vaccination campaign prompted the Health Ministry to acquire tens of millions of shots from Sao Paulo state\u2019s Butantan Institute, which is mixing an active ingredient from China with a sterile solution and bottling it. The shots were the fruit of the state\u2019s negotiations with Chinese company Sinovac and went ahead despite Bolsonaro\u2019s criticisms.Brazil\u2019s government also dragged its feet in signing on to the World Health Organization\u2019s COVAX initiative providing vaccines to poorer nations. It ultimately bought the bare minimum \u2014 enough for 10% of its population of 210 million.\u201cI was so anxious when that was going on; I couldn\u2019t believe they weren\u2019t going to sign it,\u201d said Garrett, who is Brazilian. \u201cWhen I heard they signed, I was relieved. We were all relieved. But they signed for the minimum amount possible. ... Brazil isn\u2019t in a better vaccination position now because of the incompetence or inactivity of the federal government.\u201dIn February, Brazil began signing contracts with other pharmaceutical companies, but none of their shots have been administered. Of the 10% of people who received one dose so far, the vast majority received Butantan\u2019s shot and the rest got the AstraZeneca shot, which government health institute Fiocruz is bottling.Both Brazilian labs face supply problems. Butantan said Wednesday it was suspending production while it awaits shipments of the active ingredient from China. Fiocruz has produced only 4 million of the 50 million doses it agreed to deliver by the end of April.That threatens to reduce the speed of vaccinations, which finally hit 1 million doses per day last week, according to a consortium of local media that compiles data from state health secretariats.Intensive care units for COVID-19 patients in most Brazilian states are above 90% capacity. Seven of every 10 hospitals in the country risk running out of supplemental oxygen and anesthetic in the next few days, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported April 8.At the municipal hospital of Sao Joao de Meriti, a city in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s metropolitan area, the ICU ward is almost full, with many patients sharing space and oxygen bottles while being treated. Hospital director Altair Soares Neto said health professionals scarcely find time to sleep.\u201cWill we have the medicines, the oxygen, the conditions to care for this patient accordingly? Today we do. But, if cases keep growing, sometime we will fight chaos,\u201d he said.The surge of deaths has brought widespread outcry. Brazil\u2019s Association of Collective Health, which has nearly 20,000 members including doctors, nurses and health experts, published an open letter this week demanding a three-week national lockdown, echoing increasingly urgent calls from others.Bolsonaro has refused proposed lockdowns, arguing their economic impact would be even more devastating than the virus. He even took three states to the Supreme Court last month for adopting such restrictions.\u201cIf we just wait for the vaccine to reach all risk groups, many people will die,\u201d said the health association\u2019s president, Gulnar Azevedo e Silva. \u201cThere is no national coordination. And if we don\u2019t have that, what happens? Chaos.\u201dAn agreement for FioCruz to acquire AstraZeneca\u2019s technology would allow Brazil to produce an entirely locally made vaccine and make the nation less vulnerable to constraints on imported active ingredients. Fiocruz forecasts deliveries will start in September. But that date could be pushed back due to the complexity of the process and strict quality control, its press office said in an emailed response to questions.While visiting Fiocruz on Friday, health minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters there are other countries that are also experiencing problems with their supply of active ingredients, and that vaccines won\u2019t remedy Brazil\u2019s high level of COVID-19 deaths in the short-term. He said the government doesn\u2019t have a \u201cmagic wand to fix all the problems.\u201dCarla Domingues, former coordinator of Brazil\u2019s national immunization program, praised the country for approaching 1 million doses per day but said it had the infrastructure for a stronger campaign if only the government had secured the vaccines.\u201cOf course, we would like to vaccinate more, like in the U.S., but we can't,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to live with this virus for a long time.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/brazils-virus-outlook-darkens-amid-vaccine-supply-snags-77004740", "date": "April 11, 2021, 4:26 PM"}
