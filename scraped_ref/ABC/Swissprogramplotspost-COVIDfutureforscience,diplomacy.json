They say the  pandemic has given science a platform unseen for several decades and want to leverage the attention from a public  crisis that has taken nearly 3 million lives and quashed economies to encourage thinking about the interplay among science, politics and society.Peter Brabeck, a former chairman and CEO of Nestle who was tapped by the Swiss government to lead GESDA, used COVID-19 as an example of how advance planning could help head off future health crises, noting that the mRNA vaccine technology being used now to fight the pandemic has been around a decade.\u201cWe could have perhaps been more prepared for the pandemic than we were today,\u201d Brabeck said from GESDA headquarters at Geneva\u2019s Campus Biotech. \u201cOnly a scientific breakthrough is not enough. It has to be embedded in a diplomatic framework so that it can be implemented\u201d by governments and companies.\u201cTechnology is advancing at an incredible speed. But the framework around it \u2014 diplomacy \u2014 is slower than ever, so we have to find a way that we can accelerate the diplomacy also,\u201d he said.The pandemic has featured vaccine nationalism, political squabbles and mutual recriminations between China \u2014 where the coronavirus first emerged \u2014 and the United States, which is experiencing the world\u2019s most deadly outbreak. The reputation of the World Health Organization also has suffered.\u201cI would not pretend that GESDA could avoid such a confrontation as happened in the World Health Organization,\u201d Brabeck said. \u201cWhat GESDA can do is basically to call attention before this thing escalates... (and) if diplomacy would come in before the fact, a lot of these conflicts might be resolved.\u201dBrabeck said the initiative aims to be a \u201ccatalyst\u201d and not an operator of any of the projects it looks to develop. While seed money came from the Swiss government, GESDA counts academics from places like South Africa and a top health ministry official in Singapore among board members, and is seeking outside funding and has been talking with charitable foundations.The goal of the summit planned for October is to help map the relationship between scientific breakthroughs and their impacts on society and the world. GESDA wants to assess the feasibility of structures such as an international organization to ensure safe access to quantum infrastructure and to lay a foundation for an agreement on use of artificial intelligence.It said a global court could help resolve scientific disputes, and a Manhattan Project-style research and development effort could help industry \u201caccelerate the decarbonization of industrial processes in the next decades\u201d \u2014 an allusion to the secret atomic bomb project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, during World War II.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/covid-swiss-group-plots-future-science-diplomacy-77039510", "date": "April 13, 2021, 9:30 AM"}
