For hosts Keith Urban and Mickey Guyton, there's no one more deserving of a special seat in the house than the healthcare heroes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cMy sister is a nurse and she worked with COVID patients,\" said Guyton. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve heard firsthand a lot of what she\u2019s had to go through. And it\u2019s just really cool to be able to perform for them because they have been our army for the last year.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also something very calming, knowing that the audience is full of doctors and nurses,\" said Urban.When asked if the medical workers could turn the ACM set into a pop-up vaccination clinic, the two joked that it might be a good idea.\u201cI've got mine,\u201d Urban said, referring to his COVID-19 vaccination. Guyton said she got her first vaccine dose.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Just give me a little Moderna right there,\u2019\u201d she said, patting her arm.Even though this is their first year co-hosting together, Guyton and Urban have good chemistry. Their collaborative performance on         last year's ACM Awards show in September, where they sang Guyton's \u201cBlack Like Me,\u201d got the attention of the show's organizers.In the days leading up to the show, the pair joked about coordinating their awards show fashion themes.\u201cWe're really trying to give Diana Ross vibes,\u201d said Guyton. \u201cThere's feathers. There's colors. There's shine.\"\u201cDoes that make me the Supremes?\u201d Urban responded.\u201cI can get you some lace-front wigs and then you're a part of it,\u201d Guyton said. \u201cI like it,\u201d Urban added.Guyton has achieved a number of firsts in the last year, becoming the first Black solo woman to be nominated for a Grammy in the country category for \u201cBlack Like Me\u201d and the first Black woman to host the ACM Awards.\u201cYes, I\u2019m a trailblazer, but I\u2019m also a door opener and I will hold that door open for other artists like me or not like me,\" she said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful and I take this responsibility very seriously.\u201dLeading nominees include Maren Morris, Chris Stapleton and Luke Combs; the latter two are vying for entertainer of the year alongside Eric Church, Luke Bryan and Thomas Rhett, who won the honor in a tie last year with Carrie Underwood.Some artists are already winners in pre-announced categories. Jimmie Allen was voted new male artist of the year and Gabby Barrett, who has dominated both the pop and country charts with \u201cI Hope,\" was awarded new female artist of the year. Kane Brown won video of the year for his song \u201cWorldwide Beautiful,\u201d and Carly Pearce and Lee Brice won music event of the year for their duet \u201cI Hope You're Happy Now.\u201dPerformers include Miranda Lambert with Elle King, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, Blake Shelton, Morris with her husband Ryan Hurd and Underwood with CeCe Winans.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Online:https://www.acmcountry.com/", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/keith-urban-mickey-guyton-chemistry-acm-hosts-77116536", "date": "April 16, 2021, 5:06 PM"}
