But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba\u2019s one-party system.Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the compound with D\u00edaz-Canel by his side.Castro's retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won\u2019t have a Castro formally guiding their affairs and many had been expecting the change.\u201cOne has to step aside for the young people,\" said 64-year-old retiree Juana Busutil, for whom Castro \u201cis going to continue being the leader.\u201dThe transition comes at a difficult time for Cuba, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.The  pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long  lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the \u201cspecial period\u201d that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called \u201chistoric generation\u201d represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.In January, D\u00edaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island\u2019s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise \u2014 a category long banned or tightly restricted \u2014 permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.This year\u2019s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba\u2019s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country\u2019s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel \u2014 first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it\u2019s Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of U.S. efforts to oust its socialist system.The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista.He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista. And he served for the following generation or two as head of the armed forces. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.But it was Raul who reached accords with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive U.S. opening to Cuba since the early 1960s \u2014 creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump.Now, with Raul Castro stepping down as party leader amid change and challenges, some say the island needs continuity going forward.\u201cAll process have a continuity and I think D\u00edaz-Canel should be there now,\u201d said 58-year-old driver Miguel Rodr\u00edguez.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/raul-castro-confirms-resigning-ending-long-era-cuba-77123106", "date": "April 16, 2021, 9:15 PM"}
