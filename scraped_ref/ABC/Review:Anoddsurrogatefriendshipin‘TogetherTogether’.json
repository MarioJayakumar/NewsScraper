It\u2019s fertile territory that has been fairly unexplored in popular art and brings with it a host of built in dramatic and comedic opportunities, especially with someone like Ed Helms leading the cast.Writer-director Nikole Beckwith (\u201cStockholm, Pennsylvania\u201d) instead chooses to focus on the relationship between Helms\u2019 character Matt and his surrogate, Anna (Patti Harrison) and it becomes just another semi-quirky, frustratingly surface exploration of two lonely headcases finding comfort in one another. In some ways, it\u2019s a quintessential Sundance film. The baby and the pregnancy become just a screenwriter\u2019s excuse to put these two together. It\u2019s too bad because Helms shows promise stretching in a more dramatic role and Harrison herself is a captivating presence.Matt is a 40-something app developer living a comfortable life in San Francisco. Anna is in her mid-20s and working at a coffee shop. We\u2019re introduced to them as Matt is interviewing potential surrogates and it\u2019s hardly an instant connection. In fact, it\u2019s a terribly stilted exchange that is made only somewhat funny by the excruciating awkwardness of it all. It\u2019s unclear if there were any other candidates to choose from but Matt for some reason chooses Anna as his gestational surrogate and soon they\u2019re having another stilted conversation at the doctor\u2019s office. She\u2019s pregnant.It\u2019s not the first pregnancy for Anna. In the interview we find out that she had a baby that she gave up for adoption as a teenager. The experience caused a rift with her family and she spent the next few years drifting and estranged. But she has a plan to get back on track and wants to use the money from the surrogacy to go to get a college degree in Vermont.From the start, Matt and Anna\u2019s relationship seems misguided and unhealthy. Matt starts showing up at her work and apartment bearing gifts like pregnancy tea and supportive clogs. They visit the doctor\u2019s together. They go out to dinner. They choose colors for the baby\u2019s nursery. They even go to couple\u2019s therapy together and, separately, support groups for surrogates and expectant parents using surrogates. He monitors what she eats and how she\u2019s progressing and makes a big deal out of the fact that she\u2019s still dating in the first trimester. It all seems wildly inappropriate and overbearing, especially considering Anna doesn\u2019t even want to know the sex of the baby so she doesn\u2019t get attached. And although she talks about boundaries, soon she\u2019s staying at his house on the regular and binging \u201cFriends\u201d with him.This might all be fine or understandable if Matt and Anna had some sort of chemistry with one another. I\u2019m not even suggesting anything romantic. They\u2019re just two strangers thrust together by this surrogacy agreement and spending time with them is not fun, engaging or enlightening enough to sustain a movie. A strong supporting cast including Nora Dunn, Fred Melamed, Rosalind Cho, Sufe Bradshaw and Tig Notaro can\u2019t even help all that much in their limited time on screen.Beckwith\u2019s script does have a few moments of grace and humor. Helms gets a particularly beautiful monologue about why he wants a child. And there are wry observations too about how all parenting books for single dads are for widows and divorcees. But there are far more clich\u00e9s, contrivances and threads left unnecessarily dangling.Recent films like the fertility drama \u201cPrivate Life\u201d and the adoption comedy \u201cInstant Family\u201d have successfully and entertainingly taken audiences on journeys through different facets of modern parenting. \u201cTogether Together\u201d had a chance to do that for surrogacy and single fatherhood but comes up short.\u201cTogether Together,\u201d a Bleecker Street release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America \u201cfor some sexual references and language.\u201d Running time: 90 minutes. Two stars out of four.\u2014\u2014\u2014MPAA Definition of R: Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter:         www.twitter.com/ldbahr", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-odd-surrogate-friendship-77169507", "date": "April 19, 2021, 5:15 PM"}
