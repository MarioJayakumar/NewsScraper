The report recommended 19 current and former soldiers face criminal investigation.But Defense Minister Peter Dutton, who took over the portfolio last month, said only soldiers found guilty of misconduct would lose their medals.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be punishing the 99% for the sins of 1%,\u201d Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.More than 39,000 Australian military personnel have served in Afghanistan since 2001 and 41 have been killed there. The final 80 are to be withdrawn in September, in line with the proposed U.S. withdrawal.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said later on Monday that the most powerful form of government-commissioned inquiry, known as a royal commission, would be established into suicides among serving and former military personnel.Morrison said struggling  were making greater demands on available services.\u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with right now is we see the number of presentations increasing, the demand for veteran support increasing \u2014 of course it\u2019s a function of the deployments over the last 20 years and that is the challenge that the government is dealing with now and I think we\u2019re dealing with it very positively,\u201d Morrison told reporters.Julie-Ann Finney, who lost her 38-year-old veteran son David Finney to suicide in 2019 after a battle with post traumatic stress disorder, welcomed the announcement of the Royal Commission into Defense and Veterans Suicide.\u201cToday is a long time coming for veterans and their families,\u201d Finney said.\u201cFinally, the voices of veterans will be heard. Finally, families can stand up and share their stories,\u201d she said.Research into veteran suicide in Australia is limited and imprecise.The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found last year that ex-servicemen who were discharged on medical grounds died by suicide at a higher rate than other Australian men from 2016 to 2018.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/australia-reverses-decision-withhold-medals-veterans-77159787", "date": "April 19, 2021, 5:01 AM"}
