Suga also spoke with the Pfizer chief executive, asking to ensure a more steady supply of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Japan has lagged the U.S., Israel and some European nations in a vaccine rollout, with barely 1% of its population inoculated so far.The government measures against COVID-19 infections already in some urban areas, including Tokyo, are being expanded to other areas of Japan, starting Tuesday, but the cities of Tokyo and Osaka are considering strengthening them to a \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d Japan has never had a lockdown, and its laws would need to be changed for such action.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 inched up less than 0.1% to 7,065.60, while South Korea's Kospi also was little changed, at 3,198.84.
