The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view on the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.People across Britain observed one minute of silence in honor of Philip just before the funeral got underway.Coronavirus restrictions meant that instead of the expected 800 mourners, only 30 people were allowed inside the castle\u2019s St. George\u2019s Chapel, including the queen, her four children and her eight grandchildren.Following the strict social distancing rules that England is still under, the queen set an example even in grief, sitting apart from family members who were arrayed around the church.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip at         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/ap-photos-reflections-royal-funeral-amid-pandemic-77141236", "date": "April 17, 2021, 3:33 PM"}
