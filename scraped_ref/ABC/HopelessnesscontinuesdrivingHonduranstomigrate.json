That was some 12,000 more than during March 2019.The reasons Hondurans continue to flee their country have been well documented: pervasive violence, deep-seated corruption, lack of jobs and widespread destruction from two major s that struck the region last November.Here at one of the Honduran government\u2019s reception centers for returnees, their documents were reviewed, they received medical checks and with the help of the Red Cross, they were screened for whether they could safely return to their communities.Gilles Carbonnier, vice president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, visited the center Friday during a weeklong visit to El Salvador and Honduras. Among its efforts, the Red Cross works to support people displaced by violence.On Saturday, Carbonnier told of meeting a Honduran cobbler who had a shop in a market in Tegucigalpa. One of the region\u2019s infamous street gangs was extorting him and when he could no longer pay, the gang severely beat him.The man saw no choice but to close his shop and migrate to the U.S. He was deported more than a year ago, screened at another of Honduras\u2019 reception centers and eventually referred to the Red Cross. The humanitarian agency helped him relocate and gave him some money.\u201cWith the pecuniary help we gave him, he bought the material to restart his cobbler activities and right now he has two shops, six employees and was able to restart his life,\u201d Carbonnier said.Hondurans and others around the world feel the need to migrate because of \u201ca lack of opportunity and a lack of hope,\" Carbonnier said. \"And a lack of opportunity with a lack of hope results in you saying, 'There\u2019s no space for me in this country and I\u2019m going.\u2019\u201dFor Eugenio Sosa, a sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Honduras, the assorted factors pushing Hondurans out of the country have contributed to a general hopelessness.\u201cThe people don\u2019t go just because it\u2019s really bad,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cThe people go because it\u2019s bad and because they are certain that it is going to continue to be bad and that the country has rotted forever.\u201dU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been charged with addressing the root causes of the region\u2019s migration, struck a similar note this week.She said Wednesday that the U.S. wants to use its resources \u2014 the Biden administration has spoken of $4 billion in aid \u2014 to provide the people of the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras \"with some hope that if they stay at home, help is on the way and they can have some hope that the opportunities and the needs that they have will be met in some way.\u201dSosa said even small signs of things beginning to turn around would make a difference, even if monumental challenges in the areas of health, education, jobs and corruption won\u2019t change overnight.\u201cIf the people begin to see small changes they begin to think that it\u2019s worth more to stay than to go,\u201d Sosa said.Honduran migrants set out from San Pedro Sula in caravans in December, January and March. All of the attempts to travel safely in large groups fizzled by the time they entered Guatemala. But the caravans of recent years only represent a minute fraction of the daily migration that goes mostly unseen as families or individuals strike out on their own or with the help of smugglers.The Trump administration pressured Mexico and Central American governments to more aggressively work to stop migrants. The Biden administration has sent a more compassionate message that in many cases has been mistaken as an invitation, or at least a sign of a friendlier reception. The reality however continues to be that the U.S. government quickly expels most of those arriving at its southern border.When White House officials said this week they had reached agreements with Northern Triangle governments to deploy soldiers to help combat migrant smuggling at their borders, advocacy groups criticized the administration for trying to make it more difficult for people seeking international protection.Carbonnier said countries have a right to control their borders, but also must treat migrants humanely and with dignity.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the Sahara desert, what we\u2019ve seen in the Mediterranean Sea, what we\u2019ve seen in parts of Asia, is that when stricter measures are taken to restrict the possibilities of migrating through more official ways, migration continues,\u201d Carbonnier said. \u201cThe migrants take more risks because they have to find alternative means.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hopelessness-continues-driving-hondurans-migrate-77141294", "date": "April 17, 2021, 5:02 PM"}
