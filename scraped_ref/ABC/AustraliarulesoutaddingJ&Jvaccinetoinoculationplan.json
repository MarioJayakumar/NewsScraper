A second case was reported Tuesday of a woman who was inoculated in Western Australia state and hospitalized in Darwin, regulator said in a statement.With 700,000 AstraZeneca doses injected in Australia since early March, the two cases equate to a clotting frequency of 1-in-350,000, the regulator said. British authorities say the risk of such blood clots is 1-in-250,000 in that country.The government has doubled its Pfizer order to 40 million doses and Hunt said delivery of the additional 20 million doses was expected in the last three months of 2021.\u201cThat would mean a significant sprint for those that hadn\u2019t been vaccinated by then,\u201d Hunt said, referring to the government\u2019s hope to have the population inoculated this year.Australia had hoped to administer 4 million doses of the two vaccines by the end March, but had only injected 1.2 million doses by Monday.An 80-year-old Australian man on Monday became the first COVID-19 fatality in Australia this year and the 910th since the pandemic began.The man had been living in the Philippines where he became infected. He tested positive in hotel quarantine as a returned traveler and died in a Brisbane hospital.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/australia-rules-adding-jj-vaccine-inoculation-plan-77038137", "date": "April 13, 2021, 3:19 AM"}
