It\u2019s asking to move the issue to a state court, rather than continue to work through an administrative process.The legal battle began in December, when state regulators filed an administrative complaint against Robinhood, whose easy-to-use app has helped bring a new generation of investors to the market. The app has grown so popular that the company is preparing to sell its own stock on the market through an initial public offering.In its initial complaint, Massachusetts' securities division alleged Robinhood exploited its customers to make bigger profits and failed to meet standards of conduct required by the state, something called the \u201cfiduciary rule.\u201d It said Robinhood used techniques to make investing seem like a game, such as showering users\u2019 screens with confetti, in hopes of encouraging unsophisticated customers to make more and more trades.On Thursday, the securities division said Robinhood's culture has not changed since the initial filing and that it \"continues to entice and induce inexperienced customers into risky trading.\u201d Regulators cited Robinhood\u2019s offering bonuses to customers for depositing cash in their accounts as an example of tactics that it said demonstrate a \u201ccavalier approach to complying with the duties it owes Massachusetts customers.\u201dRegulators are asking a hearing officer in the administrative case to consider revoking Robinhood's registration as a broker-dealer in the state.Also on Thursday, Robinhood filed its own suit in Massachusetts state court, asking a judge to prevent the securities division from continuing its administrative case and to declare that applying the fiduciary rule to brokerages is invalid, in part because doing so runs counter to state law.The company also said in a court filing that the state's fiduciary rule, which requires someone to provide advice solely in the financial interest of the customer, should not apply to self-directed brokerages like Robinhood, which doesn't provide investment advice. It criticized examples that Massachusetts regulators gave when accusing Robinhood of violating the fiduciary rule, such as showing customers lists of popular stocks without considering whether they were suitable investments.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe our customers are naive as the Massachusetts Securities Division paints them to be,\u201d Robinhood said in a blog posting. \u201cShowing a list of companies in a certain sector is not a recommendation.\u201dRobinhood said the complaint \u201creflects the old way of thinking: That new, younger, and more diverse investors don\u2019t have a place in the markets.\u201dEarlier this month, Robinhood stopped using animations of confetti bursting on users' screens after they made their first trade and reached other milestones, saying criticism of the animation had created a distraction.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/massachusetts-bar-robinhood-state-company-sues-77123847", "date": "April 16, 2021, 3:36 PM"}
