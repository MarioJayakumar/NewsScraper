Coronavirus restrictions mean that instead of the 800 mourners included in the longstanding plans for his funeral, there will be only 30 inside St. George\u2019s Chapel, including the widowed queen, her four children and eight grandchildren.Many elements of the funeral are steeped in military and royal protocol, from the armed forces personnel lining the funeral route to the artillery salutes and Philip\u2019s naval cap and sword atop the coffin. More than 700 military personnel are set to take part, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.To deter crowds from gathering during the pandemic, the entire procession and funeral will take place within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of London. It will be shown live on television.Philip was deeply involved in the funeral planning, and aspects of it reflect his personality, including his love of the rugged . Philip drove several versions of the four-wheel-drive vehicle for decades until he was forced to give up his license at 97 after a crash. His body will be borne to the chapel on a modified Land Rover Defender that he designed himself.The children of Philip and the queen \u2014 Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -- will walk behind the hearse. So will grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry, but not side by side. The brothers, whose relationship has been strained amid Harry\u2019s decision to quit royal duties and move to California, will flank their cousin Peter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne.The moment is likely to stir memories of the image of William and Harry at 15 and 12, walking behind their mother Princess Diana\u2019s coffin in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather Philip.Armed forces bands will play hymns and classical music before the funeral service, which will also be preceded by a nationwide minute of silence.Inside the gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, the service will be simple and somber. There will be no sermon, at Philip\u2019s request, and no family eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal protocol. But Dean of Windsor David Conner will say the country has been enriched by Philip\u2019s \u201cunwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith.\u201dPhilip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral have a maritime theme, including the hymn \u201cEternal Father, Strong to Save,\u201d which is associated with seafarers and asks God: \u201cO hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.\u201dAs Philip\u2019s coffin is lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers will sound \u201cAction Stations,\u201d an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle \u2014 a personal request from Philip.Gen. Nick Carter, the head of Britain\u2019s armed forces, said the ceremony would \u201creflect military precision and above all, I think, it will be a celebration of a life well-lived.\u201dAlong with Philip\u2019s children and grandchildren, the 30 funeral guests include other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and, like the queen, is related to a thicket of European royal families.Mourners have been instructed to wear masks and observe social distancing inside the chapel, and not to join in when a four-person choir sings hymns. The queen, who has spent much of the past year isolating with her husband at Windsor Castle, will sit alone.Since Philip\u2019s death at Windsor a week ago, many people have come to lay flowers outside the castle, despite official entreaties to stay away because of the .\u201cMainly we are here for the queen,\u201d said Barbara Lee, who came with her children and grandchildren. \u201cYou know, we feel so sorry for her, the same as we would for our own grandmothers, mothers. It\u2019s a long time to have been with somebody, a whole life, and she must be absolutely devastated. And so must they all, because at the end of the day they are a normal family.\u201dFor decades Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Awards youth program and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife\u2019s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.\u201cHe was a character, an absolute character,\u201d said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. \u201cHe was fun, he was funny. Yes, he made quite a few gaffes, but it depends which way you took it really. Just a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather, and a good example to all of us, really.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Lawless reported from London.\u2014\u2014\u2014For AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip go to         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/uk-military-prepares-big-role-prince-philips-funeral-77112958", "date": "April 16, 2021, 5:34 PM"}
