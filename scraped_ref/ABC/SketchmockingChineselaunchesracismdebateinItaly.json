But what is happening is frightening: we received a real wave of hatred that is being spread in an instrumentalized way.\u201dHunziker spoke of an organized campaign against the co-hosts, that also targeted the Trussardi fashion house founded by the family of her husband, Tomaso Trussardi. \u201cWe are talking about almond-shaped eyes made by Gerry and me, when in China there are unspeakable things happening, on which we should concentrate if we want to speak of human rights.\u201dThe producers of the show, however, refused to apologize, saying that \u201cStriscia la Notizia\u201d is satire, \u201cand like satirical and comic programs all over the world, politically incorrect.\u201dAnd they struck back, citing \u201cspurious and fascist initiatives of those who think they are blackmailing international companies and brands.\u201dIt was the second time that the pair were skewered recently on social media, after they replayed an older sketch that used racist language to describe African children. And it comes a week after Black Lives Matter protests outside the Rome studios of RAI state television over on-air racist language and the use of blackface on one show.The co-hosts had their defenders, who on radio shows decried what they saw as the importation of \u2018cancel culture\u2019 from the United States and the death knell of satire.A representative of the Chinese community in Milan, Francesco Wu, said satire should be aimed at the powerful, not against minorities, especially those easily singled out.\"In this historic context, when there are many episodes of violence against the Asian community around the world, we need to be careful and not convey a message that can generate racism and discrimination,'' Wu told The Associated Press.Wu said he made the same points in an interview with \u201cStriscia la Notizia\u201d in a bid to calm tensions. He emphasized that the threats against the co-hosts did not come from the Chinese community.Black Italian activist Maddalena Fadika said shows like \u201cStriscia la Notizia\u201d normalize racism. \u201cEverything is taken as satire, as a joke, stereotypes projected on minorities are taken as normal,\u2019\u2019 she said.Black Lives Matter protests have grown in Italy in the last year, campaigning for looser citizenship laws for the children of foreign residents and underlining that Italy is already a multicultural society, with more than 1.2 million African-origin residents.Chinese comprise the third-largest non-EU population in Italy, numbering some 320,000, with a strong business presence in textile-making in Tuscany and in Italy's financial capital Milan. Panic over the coronavirus in the last year has made them increasingly the target of discrimination.An influencer who goes by the name of Momoka Banana said in a video post that she endured teasing for her Chinese appearance growing up in Rome.\u201cIt didn\u2019t make me feel comfortable,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIn fact, it made me ashamed of my origins, so much that I refused for many years to learn Chinese.\u2019\u2019Even now, Momoka Banana, who frequently shares stories of her life on Instagram and , said she endures people yelling on the street to make fun of the typical Chinese accent.\u201cPeople say, what do you care about the jokes, you are stronger,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cYes, OK, at the threshold of 30 years, I can say they are idiots, those who make fun of me. But I would not like that my nieces and nephews are made fun of at school, perhaps by classmates who saw \u2018Striscia la Notizia,\u2019 and found the joke funny.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/sketch-mocking-chinese-launches-racism-debate-italy-77097638", "date": "April 15, 2021, 9:30 PM"}
