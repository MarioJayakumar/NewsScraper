Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa. standing nearby with a group of advocates, some of them veterans.\"It's unconscionable, and it's easily remedied,\" he added. \"And they don't need to be put through another bureaucratic process and another clerical process, they don't need another study to determine whether or not it might not be that healthy to burn everything in sight 24-hours a day, seven days a week, next to where you're sleeping. We know it, because you're not allowed to do it in the United States of America.\"The U.S. military has regularly used burn pits to dispose of waste, including chemicals, munitions, Styrofoam and human waste, at military sites in Iraq and Afghanistan. The smoke released chemicals that veterans' advocates have linked to cancers and respiratory illnesses. Burn pits are no longer in regular use, , which in March 2019 said there were nine left.Called the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act, the bill would no longer require veterans to establish a direct service connection between their health condition and exposure in order to receive care.

In the past, he has talked about the possible connection between burn pits and his son's brain cancer.\"My son did a year in Iraq. He came home. We lost him, but he came home and one of the things we should be looking at is those burn pits that are there,\" Biden said at a  in 2019. \"It\u2019s just like, you know, when all the firemen in New York went down to 9/11 and so many got cancer, and particularly brain cancer. Well, that's what's happening.\"\"More people are coming home from Iraq with brain cancer than ever before, than any other war,\" he added. \"And we\u2019re in a situation where there's a direct connection between those burn pits and taking in that -- all that toxin that's available. And we should say, anybody who was anywhere near those burn pits, that's all they have to show and they get covered, they get all their health care covered.\"At Tuesday's press conference, Gillibrand said it was a \"moral outrage\u201d that veterans were fighting to get health care coverage for diseases linked to burn pit exposure and that she had spoken with Biden about the issue.\"This is the cost of war. This is what it costs. It costs the lives of men and women who sacrifice everything,\u201d she said. \"And when you are so ill-advised to put burn pits and bases and burn everything you can imagine, with jet fuel, what do you expect?

He testified on Capitol Hill in 2019 and gave an impassioned speech to encourage lawmakers to replenish the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, which was passed that year. He has also supported similar legislation on burn pits in the past.\"I hope you understand that, you know, it turns out, veterans are human beings. They're not just flags and not just bumper stickers,\" Stewart said at the end of Tuesday's press conference.\"You know, these men and women swore an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic,\" he added. \"Well, what do you do when you fulfill that obligation and you come home, and the enemy is now negligence and bureaucracy and apathy?\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jon-stewart-lawmakers-announce-legislation-veterans-impacted-burn/story?id=77043014", "date": "April 13, 2021, 4:36 PM"}
