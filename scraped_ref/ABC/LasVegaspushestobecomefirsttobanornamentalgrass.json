By ripping it out, they estimate the region can reduce annual water consumption by roughly 15% and save about 14 gallons (53 liters) per person per day.Las Vegas might be known for splashy displays like the Bellagio fountains on the neon-lit Strip, but officials say residents of bedroom communities and sprawling suburbs embrace conservation measures, including aggressive monitoring of sprinklers and leaky irrigation systems.\u201cThe public perception outside of Las Vegas is certainly much different \u2014 and has been for a long time \u2014 than the water conservation ethic within the community,\u201d said Colby Pellegrino, Southern Nevada Water Authority water resources director.California         imposed a temporary ban on watering ornamental grass during last decade's         drought, but no state or major city has tried to phase out certain categories of grass permanently.\u201cThe scale of this is pretty unprecedented in terms of a full ban on this nonfunctional turf,\u201d said John Berggren, a water policy analyst at Western Resource Advocates.The proposal is part of a turf war waged since at least 2003, when the water authority banned developers from planting green front yards in new subdivisions. It also offers owners of older properties the region's most generous rebate policies to tear out sod \u2014 up to $3 per square foot.Those efforts are slowing. The agency says the number of acres converted under its rebate program fell last year to six times less than what it was in 2008. Meanwhile, water consumption in southern Nevada has increased 9% since 2019.Last year was among the driest in the region's history, when Las Vegas went a record 240 days without measurable rainfall. And the future flow of the Colorado River, which accounts for 90% of southern Nevada's water, is in question.The waterway supplies Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming and Mexico. As drought and climate change decrease what the river provides, the amount allocated to Arizona, California and Nevada         is projected  to be cut further.Justin Jones, a Clark County commissioner who serves on the water authority's board, doesn't think ripping out ornamental turf will upend people's lives.\u201cTo be clear, we are not coming after your average homeowner\u2019s backyard,\u201d he said. But grass in the middle of a parkway, where no one walks: \u201cThat's dumb.\"\"The only people that ever set foot on grass that\u2019s in the middle of a roadway system are people cutting the grass,\u201d Jones said.The agency has different regulations for yards and public parks. Based on satellite imaging, it believes banning ornamental grass will primarily affect common areas maintained by homeowner associations and commercial property owners.Jones said the proposal has drawn resistance in some master-planned communities, but water officials say years of drought-awareness campaigns and policies like the rebates have cultivated a cultural change.Southern Nevada Homebuilders\u2019 Association lobbyist Matt Walker said consumer preferences have reached the point that potential homebuyers from wetter regions aren't turned off from neighborhoods that have parks but no ornamental grass.Conservation frees water, reduces per capita consumption and strengthens builders\u2019 arguments that the desert can accommodate more growth, Walker said. \"And the benefits are the ability to keep doing what we do, which is building homes.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve really gotten a comfort level that buyers are very much willing to go along with responsible development practices when it comes to water use,\" he added.Other desert cities aren't so sure. Salt Lake City has an ordinance that requires a certain amount of yard and median greenery. Phoenix, where some neighborhoods remain lush from flood irrigation, has never offered grass removal rebates.Water officials elsewhere are loath to compare their policies to southern Nevada. Particularly in cities where water consumption per person is high, they say there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach for a drier future.Las Vegas, for example, mostly ignores toilets, showers and dishwashers because the water authority is able to treat and recycle indoor wastewater and let it flow through a natural wash into Lake Mead \u2014 the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam. It is filtered again for reuse.A draconian anti-grass policy might not work in downtown Phoenix, said Cynthia Campbell, water resources adviser for the nation's fifth-largest city. Trees and grass blunt public health dangers of \u201c         urban heat islands \u201d \u2014 areas lacking green landscaping to offset heat through evaporative cooling.Regional water officials understand future consumption will have to be reduced but fear the preparation and perception could backfire if the community doesn't buy in.\u201cThere comes a point when people\u2019s demands start to harden,\" Campbell said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018This is the point of no return for me.' For some people, it\u2019s a pool. For some people, it\u2019s grass.\u201dThe Southern Nevada Water Authority isn't sure the idea of banning grass will spread to other cities. But Pellegrino, the water resources chief, said other places will have to make changes.\"Particularly every community that relies on Colorado River water.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Metz reported from Carson City, Nevada, and is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
