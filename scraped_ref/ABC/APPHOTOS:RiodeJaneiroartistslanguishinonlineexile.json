But with virus         , concert halls and theaters stay shut. Some venues, like the         \u201cThe magic of the crowd is missing, that exchange, and I feel like half of myself,\u201d Szpilman says. \u201cI try to imagine I\u2019m presenting on stage and withdraw that energy from my soul for the crowd.\u201dMembers of the municipal theater\u2019s choir, orchestra and ballet are technically public servants, and have continued to receive their salaries from Rio\u2019s state government while performing online.Others are less fortunate, including Regina Oliveira, a clown and trapeze performer who is part of the          group.Oliveira has transformed her apartment in the bohemian Santa Teresa neighborhood into a small studio for classes and performances. With a bright red nose and striped tights, she swings from the ceiling and strives to entertain.\u201cEverything became virtual, because it was imagined that the pandemic would end. But the pandemic didn\u2019t end, and it got worse,\u201d she says. \u201cI perceive that, as time passes, the public is tiring of such a virtual relationship.\u201dBrazil\u2019s Congress last year approved a 3 billion reais ($527 million) lifeline for artists, as well as to sustain cultural venues and small performance companies forced to cease activities. The law was named for composer Aldir Blanc, best known for          who died last year from COVID-19. During the military dictatorship, the song became an anthem in defense of political exiles, many of whom were artists.Raquel Pot\u00ed, a stilts instructor, was the creative director for an online spectacle that was financed with funds from the Aldir Blanc law and called \u201cGiant Dreamers.\u201d Costumed artists         . Still, she had to move back with her parents during the pandemic and has been tapping her savings.One of the municipal theater\u2019s other stars, ballerina Claudia Mota, is also stuck at home.The floor of her adapted living room is unfit for pointe technique and she uses her staircase\u2019s banister like a ballet barre for warm-ups. She is limited, though, in how thoroughly she can train her body, which she calls \u201cmy work material.\u201d\u201cWhen I return, I\u2019m going to need time to restructure myself,\u201d Mota says. \u201cIt will be little by little, because the body is asleep.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writer David Biller contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/ap-photos-rio-de-janeiro-artists-languish-online-77041922", "date": "April 13, 2021, 8:07 AM"}
