They just came in unannounced,\u201d Gordon added.Gordon led a community meeting on the subject last week and complained that most of the cast were not from Byron Bay.Netflix said its first Australian reality series would \u201caim to build a connection between the people we meet in the show and the audience.\u201d\u201cThe show is authentic and honest, and while it carries all the classic hallmarks of the form and embraces the drama, heartbreak and conflict that makes for such entertaining viewing, our goal is to lift the curtain on influencer culture to understand the motivation, the desire, and the pain behind this very human need to be loved,\u201d a Netflix statement said.\u201cThe reason behind choosing Byron Bay as a location was driven by the area\u2019s unique attributes as a melting pot of entrepreneurialism, lifestyle and health practices, and the sometimes uneasy coming together of the traditional \u2018old Byron\u2019 and the alternative \u2018new,\u2019 all of which we\u2019ll address in the series,\u201d the statement added.The town of 9,000 people is one of the most famous in Australia, partly because acting couple Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky have built a mansion there. International celebrities who are based or spend time in Byron Bay include Matt Damon, Zac Efron and Simon Baker.Richardson, the mayor, said the town 625 kilometers (388 miles) north of Sydney did not need the type of tourists who \u201cmight be turned on by a vacuous vision of who we are.\u201d\u201cIf we become a laughing stock through a really vacuous, fake show, it could have big \u2014 not just sensitivity challenges for us \u2014 but also economic challenges,\u201d Richardson said.Byron Bay activists have successfully stood up to big business in the past. The town has prevented KFC and McDonalds from opening restaurants there after protest campaigns.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/byron-bay-locals-protest-planned-netflix-reality-series-77179741", "date": "April 19, 2021, 11:08 PM"}
