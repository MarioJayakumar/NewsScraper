That takes the total expected from the company during the second quarter to 50.3 million jabs.Rival Moderna is increasing its deliveries to 6.4 million for Germany during that period.\u201cThe vaccination campaign is gaining speed significantly during the second quarter,\u201d Health Minster Jens Spahn said.Germany has also approved the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, though it is restricted to people aged 60 and over. Spahn indicated he expects the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine to also be approved by European regulators.Like most European Union countries, Germany has so far given a first dose of coronavirus vaccine to about a fifth of its population. Other countries in the 27-nation bloc can expect to also receive more doses in the coming months, as Pfizer announced it would provide an additional 100 million shots to the EU this year, taking the total to 600 million.The increase in deliveries is welcome news for countries like Germany, which have been seeing a steady rise in new cases lately.In an effort to cut the infection rate, the German government has asked parliament to approve a bill that would give federal authorities greater powers to set pandemic restrictions.The latest draft of the bill envisages a night-time curfew from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. with limited exceptions in regions where the number of new weekly infections tops 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. This would currently apply to almost all regions in Germany. Schools would be shut when the rate is above 165 newly confirmed cases a week per 100,000 inhabitants, the German news agency dpa reported.Germany has sought to keep more areas of life \u2014 from schools to stores to zoos \u2014 open by requiring that people take a rapid coronavirus test before being allowed inside.\u2014\u2014\u2014", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/germany-expects-vaccine-deliveries-ramp-2nd-quarter-77168253", "date": "April 19, 2021, 12:46 PM"}
