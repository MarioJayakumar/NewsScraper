The agency plans to gradually expand programs to reach 1.5 million children by providing school meals, spending on remodeling school cafeterias and training staff on food safety standards.\u201cThe children and the schools will be at the centre of our operation,\u201d World Food Program executive director David Beasley said in a statement. \u201cWe believe the school is the most appropriate platform for WFP to reach communities in an independent manner.\u201dThe announcement comes as Venezuela grapples with soaring food prices amid four-digit inflation, making it challenging for families to afford nutritious meals. The Rome-based agency has estimated that one of every three Venezuelans is struggling to consume enough daily calories.Unlike recent years, when food insecurity was mainly a consequence of basic food shortages, the fundamental cause now is the high prices set in dollars. The average salary is less than $5 a month, which in most cases includes minimum wage and bonuses, but a chicken costs $2.40 per kilo (2.2 pounds).A joint analysis by World Food Program and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in October included Venezuela among 20 countries that were \u201clikely to face potential spikes in high acute food insecurity\u201d over the following three to six months and required \u201curgent attention.\u201dThe agency\u2019s goal is to reach 185,000 students by year\u2019s end and 1.5 million by the end of the 2022-2023 school year. It estimated the food assistance program\u2019s annual budget at $190 million.\u201cWe are relying on the support of the international donor community to back our operation in Venezuela,\u201d said Beasley, who traveled to Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas, to meet with government officials.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Beasley met at the presidential palace. Maduro in a televised event expressed his satisfaction that a first step of many others has been taken as part of \u201ca set of ambitious projects that include food support for the entire people of Venezuela\u201d following three years of \u201capproach, encounters, disagreements.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/agency-provide-food-assistance-venezuelan-children-77174688", "date": "April 19, 2021, 7:45 PM"}
