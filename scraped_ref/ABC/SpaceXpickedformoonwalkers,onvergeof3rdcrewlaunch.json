The contract is worth $2.89 billion.\u201cWe won't stop at the moon,\u201d said NASA's acting administrator Steve Jurczyk. Mars is the ultimate goal, he told reporters.NASA declined to provide a target launch date for the moon-landing Artemis mission, saying a review is underway. The Trump administration had set a 2024 deadline, but on Friday, NASA officials called it a goal.\u201cWe'll do it when it's safe,\" said Kathy Lueders, who leads NASA's human space exploration office.She indicated NASA and SpaceX are shooting for later this decade. The astronauts will fly to the moon on the NASA-launched Orion capsule, then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface and back.NASA has said at least one of the first moonwalkers since 1972 would be the first woman on the moon. Another goal of the program, according to the space agency, is to send a person of color to the lunar surface.On Friday, Jurczyk greeted the four astronauts arriving at Kennedy Space Center for SpaceX's third crew launch in less than a year. By coincidence, their flight to the International Space Station is set for next Thursday \u2014 Earth Day. It's a reminder of NASA's core mission of studying the home planet, Jurczyk said.The three men and one woman represent the U.S., France and Japan: NASA's Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Thomas Pesquet and Akihiko Hoshide, all experienced space fliers.\u201cIt's definitely getting real,\u201d Kimbrough, the spacecraft commander, said after arriving by plane from Houston.This will be SpaceX's first crew flight to use a recycled Falcon rocket and Dragon crew capsule. NASA turned to U.S. private companies for crew transport after the space shuttle program ended in 2011.\u201cCertainly, I think all of them, until we get several years under our belt, should be considered test flights,\u201d Kimbrough told reporters.SpaceX uses the same kind of rocket and similar capsules for supply deliveries, and recycles those as well.McArthur is the only member of the crew who has yet to visit the space station. She flew the shuttle to the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. And launching out of Kennedy is new to Pesquet after more than 11 years as an astronaut.\u201cWe\u2019re living in the golden age of human spaceflight,\u201d said Pesquet, a former Air France pilot. \u201cLooks like everybody, every country, has a project or a spacecraft.\u201dThe astronauts left the runway in a pair of white gull-winged Teslas; SpaceX founder Musk also runs the electric car company. They had an early bedtime to sync up with what will be pretty much an all-nighter Thursday. Liftoff time is 6:11 a.m.The four will replace the SpaceX crew that launched last November. Those four will return to Earth at the end of April. A fresh three-person Soyuz crew, meanwhile, arrived at the space station last week from Kazakhstan, replacing two Russians and one American due back on Earth this weekend.\u2014\u2014\u2014The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
