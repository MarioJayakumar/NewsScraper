The heir to the throne said he was touched by the number of people around the world who have shared his family\u2019s loss and sorrow.\u201cMy dear Papa was a very special person who I think, above all else, would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him,\u2033 Charles said, speaking from his southwestern England home of Highgrove. \u201cAnd from that point of view we are, my family, deeply grateful for all that. It will sustain us in this particular loss and at this particularly sad time.\u2019\u2019Philip\u2019s royal ceremonial funeral will take place April 17 at Windsor Castle \u2014 a slimmed-down service amid the COVID-19 pandemic that will be entirely closed to the public. The palace insisted the royals would strictly adhere to national virus guidelines, measures that in theory would entail mask wearing in an enclosed space and social distancing. The palace declined to comment on specifics.Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years who was also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, took part in planning his own funeral and its focus on family was in accordance with his wishes. The duke also took part in designing the modified Land Rover that will carry his coffin.\u201cAlthough the ceremonial arrangements are reduced, the occasion will still celebrate and recognize the duke\u2019s life and his more than 70 years of service to the Queen, the UK and the Commonwealth,\u201d a palace spokesman said Saturday while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy.Prince Harry, Philip\u2019s grandson who stepped away from royal duties last year and now lives in California, will attend the service at Windsor along with other members of the royal family. His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is pregnant and has been advised by her doctor not to make the long journey to the U.K.Another no-show will be Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose office said he would not attend because current coronavirus restrictions limit funerals to 30 people, so by staying away that would \u201callow for as many family members as possible.''The palace appealed to the public not to gather in Windsor or at Buckingham Palace in London to pay their respects to Philip \u2014 advice that was roundly disregarded by many.Earlier Saturday, military teams across the U.K. and on ships at sea fired 41-gun salutes to mark Philip's death, honoring the former naval officer whom they considered one of their own.Batteries in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast \u2014 the capitals of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as other cities around the U.K. and the Mediterranean outpost of Gibraltar fired the volleys at one-minute intervals beginning at midday. Ships including the HMS Montrose, a frigate patrolling the Persian Gulf, offered their own salutes.\u201cThe Duke of Edinburgh served among us during the Second World War, and he remained devoted to the Royal Navy and the Armed Forces as a whole,\u201d Gen. Nick Carter, chief of the defense staff, said in a statement. \u201cA life well-lived. His Royal Highness leaves us with a legacy of indomitable spirit, steadfastness and an unshakeable sense of duty.\u201dMembers of the Commonwealth, a group of 54 countries headed by the queen, were also invited to honor Philip. The Australian Defense Force began its salute at 5 p.m. outside Parliament House in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to offer its own tribute on Sunday.Philip joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939 and once had a promising military career. In 1941, he was honored for his service during the battle of Cape Matapan off the coast of Greece, when his control of searchlights aboard the HMS Valiant allowed the battleship to pinpoint enemy vessels in the dark. Philip rose to the rank of commander before he retired from active duty.Two years after the war ended, Philip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey when she was 21 and he was 26. Philip\u2019s naval career came to an abrupt end when King George VI died in 1952 and his wife became queen.At the queen\u2019s coronation in 1953, Philip swore to be his wife\u2019s \u201cliege man of life and limb\u201d and settled into a life supporting the monarch. The couple had four children \u2014 Charles, the heir to the throne, Anne, Andrew and Edward.Before he retired from official duties in 2017, the prince carried out more than 22,000 solo public engagements and supported over 780 organizations, including the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award for young people.Members of the public continued to honor Philip\u2019s life of service, leaving flowers Saturday outside Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.\u201cI think everyone would like to pay their respects,\u201d Maureen Field, 67, said outside Windsor Castle. \u201cBecause of the virus, a lot of people have to stay away. He didn\u2019t want a big funeral. He wanted a very private time with his family to say their goodbyes. So, we\u2019ve all got to respect that.\u201dMike Williams, 50, traveled from his home in Surrey, southwest of London, to Buckingham Palace to honor the prince.\u201cHe\u2019s a massive loss to the country and to the world, I think, so we wanted to come and pay respects,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it achieves, but it just felt like the right thing to do.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press Writer James Brooks and Tom Rayner contributed.\u2014\u2014\u2014For AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip go to         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/gun-salutes-mark-death-uks-prince-philip-76991682", "date": "April 10, 2021, 3:53 PM"}
