He said it's \u201cappropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this.\u201dThe Competition and Markets Authority had already started earlier this year inviting third parties to provide their views on the anticipated sale and its impact on competition.When the acquisition was first announced in September last year, Nvidia pledged to keep Arm\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge while also promising to expand on Arm\u2019s work to build a \u201cworld-class\u201d technology center.\u201cFollowing careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Arm, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,\u201d Dowden said. \u201cAs a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the U.K.\u2019s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.\"The CMA will advise whether the takeover could lead to a substantial lessening of competition in any market in the U.K., and whether it should be put through further scrutiny in a \u2018phase two\u2019 investigation.It will have until July 30 to complete the report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-assess-security-implications-nvidia-takeover-arm-77164702", "date": "April 19, 2021, 10:06 AM"}
