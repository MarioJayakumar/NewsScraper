Why was not he arrested during the past year?\u201d said defense counsel Jainul Abedin Mezbah.Security was tight at the court as Haque was escorted from an office in the Detective Branch where he was kept overnight for initial questioning. The law requires that arrested suspects be produced in front of a magistrate within 24 hours.Haque, 47, is a leader of the Hefazat-e-Islam group, which has a strong network of Islamic schools across Bangladesh. The group says it is not a political party, but its leaders regularly preach about the country\u2019s politics and advocate an Islamic revolution. Its leaders often challenge the constitution and legal system, which is based on British common law.Haque has strongly opposed the government\u2019s policy of building closer ties with neighboring Hindu-majority India.The group criticized Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for inviting Modi to join a March 26 celebration of the country\u2019s 50th anniversary of independence. Critics accuse Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist party of stoking religious polarization in India and discriminating against minorities, particularly Muslims.Modi\u2019s two-day visit was undermined by violence in which at least 17 supporters of Hefazat-e-Islam were killed in clashes with police as they attacked a police station and other government buildings and blocked highways. In Dhaka, they clashed with police outside the main Baitul Mokarram Mosque during the visit.In a speech to Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament earlier this month, Hasina warned the group and its leaders that they would face consequences if they continue to use violence.Haque and his associates led a recent campaign against plans to erect a statue of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father, saying sculptures are un-Islamic. The government backed off.Hefazat-e-Islam also wants Hasina\u2019s government to enact blasphemy laws under which anyone convicted of criticizing Islam\u2019s prophet would face the death penalty.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-court-police-question-islamist-leader-77160445", "date": "April 19, 2021, 6:39 AM"}
