Models walked down long corridor runways outfitted with hundreds of flashing cameras nailed to the wall in the place of absent paparazzi. A medley of Gucci-themed pop songs \u2014 proof, if needed, of the brand\u2019s enduring relevance \u2014 provided the soundtrack.The first look was a jag on Tom Ford\u2019s 1996 red velvet suit, with a kinky leather harness over a powder blue shirt. Michele said in notes that he had \u201cplundered\u201d the \u201csexual tension\u201d of Ford\u2019s decade at Gucci from 1994-2004.\u201cTom understood right from the beginning that Gucci had some kind of magnetism, this cult power,\u201d Michele said.Michele, who took over as creative direction of Gucci six years ago, put a fetishized spin on Gucci\u2019s trademark equestrian references, including riding caps, fringed leather riding crops and spit-polished boots mixed with glamorous sequined evening wear, or subverted with erotic sheer dresses of logo-emblazoned netting. Models dangled long jewelry from their noses.In one of the collection's most surprising turns, Michele borrowed, or hacked, looks directly from Balenciaga, the Paris fashion house owned by the same parent company, Kering. They included a version of the Balenciaga Jackie bag and a glittery silver suit emblazoned with both Gucci and Balenciaga.This was the first collection of 2021 for Gucci, which has left the fashion calendar and committed to only presenting two collections a year. The video presentation stuck strictly to the runway format during a pandemic year of experimentation that has all but shut down in-person shows.Reflecting on the century marker, Michele said Gucci's magic is its ability to redefine itself over time, unbeholden to any strictly defined image.\u201cI am trying to renew for the millionth time this brand, this name, this myth, this saga, because Gucci is a complex container that holds many, many things,\u201d Michele said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/gucci-celebrates-100-years-micheles-aria-collection-77102563", "date": "April 15, 2021, 4:36 PM"}
