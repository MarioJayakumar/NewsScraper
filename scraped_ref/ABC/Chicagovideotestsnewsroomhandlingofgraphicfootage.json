They showed jumpy body camera footage of officer Eric Stillman chasing Toledo and ordering him to drop a gun, followed by Toledo's empty hands being raised. The video is stopped at the moment of the fatal shot.In some depictions, like on CNN's \u201cAnderson Cooper 360,\u201d a second video angle from a distance shows Toledo crumpling to the ground. Some outlets also aired brief scenes of Stillman trying to revive the teen.\u201cThe news media has gotten much better at stopping the frame before someone's last moment,\u201d said Allissa Richardson, professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt's finally starting to sink in that we can tell these stories without the final moment of impact.\u201dSaid \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d anchor Gayle King: \u201cI don't want to see him get shot.\u201dTelevision executives recognize they have a responsibility to protect viewers from excessively disturbing footage, said Mark Whitaker, a former CNN and NBC News executive. They also recognize that most consumers, if they want to see more of the confrontation, have other options online.The video was the lead story Friday on the Chicago Tribune's website, with a headline warning of graphic content. With two clicks, visitors could see video of the entire confrontation and its gory aftermath.Block Club Chicago, a subscription-based site for local news, let customers choose to read about Toledo without access to the video or to read a second story where, with a few clicks, they could see an edited portion that ends with Toledo falling to the ground.\u201cPeople have different news needs,\u201d said Jen Sabella, co-founder and director of strategy for Block Club Chicago. \u201cSome people are happy to read a story and move on with their day, and some people want to go a little deeper.\u201dBut it was also an approach born of Sabella's own reaction to the video, together with the cumulative impact of the trial of former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin bringing back images of George Floyd's death and the separate police shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in a Minneapolis suburb.\u201cWhen I watched (the Chicago shooting), I felt super sick,\u201d Sabella said. \u201cIt was a gut punch. I want people to read about that without having to see it.\u201dShortly after the video was released, Brian Carovillano, vice president and managing editor of The Associated Press, sent an email to staff members warning that many people who had seen it found it very upsetting.\u201cWe want to assure you that you don't have to watch this,\u201d Carovillano wrote. \u201cThe journalists who are managing and covering the story have what they need.\u201dEdited portions of the video appeared on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts on Thursday, which together reach around 20 million people. The top-rated program, ABC's \u201cWorld News Tonight,\u201d repeated the chase scene four times.USC's Richardson said journalists have to think about the effect these police videos have on followers; she shields her children from them. She said she understands why showing them is necessary, particularly when the footage contradicts official reports, but she looks forward to when scenes of suffering don't have to be aired.\u201cI equate it with lynching photography,\u201d she said.Danielle Kilgo, a professor of journalism, diversity and equality at the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities, said she sees the value of videos helping to make police incidents more than he said-she said stories. She understands the reasoning behind freezing the Toledo video just before he's shot but also worries that doing so leaves room for conspiracy theorists to thrive.News organizations in virtually all cases warned people that what they were about to see could be considered graphic or disturbing.CBS' King, in an interview, said she worries that such warnings are becoming so routine that they are becoming white noise to viewers.\u201cIt used to be when you heard something like that, you'd say, \u2018Oh, my God, what\u2019s about to happen?'\u201d she said. \u201cNow you almost don't hear it.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/chicago-video-tests-newsroom-handling-graphic-footage-77127585", "date": "April 17, 2021, 1:30 AM"}
