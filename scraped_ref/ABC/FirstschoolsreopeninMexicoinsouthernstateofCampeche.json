However, vaccinations for teachers in five more states with relatively low levels of coronavirus cases are scheduled to start Tuesday.While it may have been good to get back to school, the scene in Campache was different from before: Students were allowed back in small groups to maintain social distancing, and they wore face masks and plastic face shields.Jacinto Javier Uc Ordo\u00f1ez teaches fourth to sixth grade, and also serves as the director, at the Valent\u00edn Gomez Far\u00edas primary school in the Maya village of Monte Bello. Instead of welcoming his classes back all at one time, on Monday he saw his fourth-graders three at a time for briefer 1 1/2- or 2-hour sessions.\u201cI feel happy to go back to school, to see my teacher, to see my classmates,\u201d said fourth-grader Jade Sarahi Chan Puc, 10. She was also enthused because the school is one of the only places in the village with internet.Mexico has faced unique challenges in trying to keep students up to date with schoolwork during the pandemic, Many students do not have computers or internet access at home.\u201cHere in Monte Bello, there is no internet, the signal doesn't reach here, there is nothing,\u201d Uc Ordo\u00f1ez said, noting that throughout the pandemic, he and other teachers personally delivered each student's homework to their homes.Jade Sarahi's mother, Hermelinda Puc Kuk, is also happy classes are starting again. As for many parents all over the world, distance learning has been difficult, with some special challenges in their village.\u201cThe homework will be easier, because you had to find time to help her,\u201d said Puc Kuk. \u201cThe teacher can help her better.\u201dMexico has suffered almost 212,500 test-confirmed deaths from COVID-19, but because the country does so little testing, authorities acknowledge the real toll is over 330,000.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/schools-reopen-mexico-southern-state-campeche-77177666", "date": "April 19, 2021, 9:28 PM"}
