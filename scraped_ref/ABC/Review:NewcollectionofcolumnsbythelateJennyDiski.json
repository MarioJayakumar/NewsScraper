{"title": "Review: New collection of columns by the late Jenny Diski", "body": "Jenny Diski started contributing to the London Review of Books in 1993 and wrote more than 200 columns before her 2016 death\u201cWhy Didn\u2019t You Just Do What You Were Told?\u201d by Jenny Diski (Bloomsbury Publishing)A lot of criticism doesn\u2019t age well because it\u2019s tied to ephemeral moments in our cultural life. Jenny Diski\u2019s is likely to stand the test of time because it offers readers a bracing mix of razor-sharp analysis and wrenchingly honest autobiography.\u201cWhy Didn\u2019t you Just Do What You Were Told?\u201d brings together 33 of more than 200 columns she wrote for the London Review of Books over a prolific career that included novels, short stories, memoir and travelogues. Most are book reviews, giving her a springboard for wide-ranging reflections on everyone from Jeffrey Dahmer and Denis Thatcher to Anne Frank, Princess Margaret, Martha Freud (wife of Sigmund), Roald Dahl, and many more.In the essay on Dahl, she explains why \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and other books by the famously unpleasant author are so wildly popular with kids. \u201cThey speak to the last overt remains of the disreputable, unsocialized, inelegant parts of themselves the grown-ups are trying so hard to push firmly underground.\u201dHere she is in 2007, reflecting on the \u201csentimentality and hysteria\u201d that washed over Kensington Palace after  died. \u201cTen years on \u2026 it isn\u2019t entirely obvious what fascinated people so \u2026 Take the bright lights away and you have a regular messy divorce \u2026 The only remarkable thing was that he left her for an older woman.\u201dThe most gripping have to do with her own extraordinary life, including a lifelong struggle with depression, suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, and a 2014 diagnosis of inoperable lung cancer that killed her less than two years later at age 68.Diski was born in London in 1947, the daughter of working-class immigrant Jews, who subjected her, together and separately, to neglect and abuse. As a troubled teenager, she was taken in by Doris Lessing, launching a fraught relationship with the celebrated writer that she only wrote about after Lessing\u2019s 2013 death.The essay \u201cA Diagnosis\u201d is about finding out she has cancer and realizing that despite the clich\u00e9 of the cancer diary, she knows she\u2019ll have to do one, too \u2014 in her own inimitably personal way.\u201cWhat else am I going to write about but how I know and don\u2019t know the world? I may not make things up in fiction, or tell the truth in non-fiction, but documentary or invented, it\u2019s always been me at the center of the will to put descriptions out into the world.\u201dIt\u2019s as good an account as any for what she\u2019s up to in these mordantly funny and brilliant essays.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-collection-columns-late-jenny-diski-77165518", "date": "April 19, 2021, 10:41 AM"}
