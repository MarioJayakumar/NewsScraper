Happy to be joining #TheBrotherHood.\"John, a 6-foot-9 senior center from Minneapolis, ends his Marquette career with the second most blocked shots in program history. He has started 87 games over the past three seasons, emerging as one of the best defensive players in the Big East. This past season, he averaged 8.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks and shot 57.2% from the field.Duke badly needed some experience and physicality up front, and John should immediately step in and provide depth down low. The Blue Devils lost forward          to the NBA draft earlier this week, and reserve big man          entered the transfer portal last month. Freshman          is an NBA prospect but is likely to return to Durham next season; he and John should form a formidable duo.John was ranked No. 85 in ESPN's transfer rankings.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/duke-blue-devils-strengthen-frontcourt-adding-marquette-golden/story?id=77118264", "date": "April 16, 2021, 11:39 AM"}
