They said Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would speak later this month and planned to meet in person later this year.The long-planned trip would have been Johnson\u2019s first foreign visit since the start of the coronavirus pandemic more than a year ago. It was originally scheduled for January but was postponed when infections soared in Britain.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock told lawmakers in the House of Commons that India would be added to a \u201cred list\u201d of countries with high coronavirus rates. Starting Friday, people who have been in India within the previous 10 days won't be allowed into the U.K. The exceptions are U.K. citizens and returning residents of Britain and Ireland, who face 10 days of mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival.Millions of people in Britain have roots or relatives in India, and Hancock said that \u201cbetween our two countries we have ties of friendship and family.\u201d\u201cI understand the impact of this decision, but I hope the House will concur that we must act,\u201d he said.Hancock said the U.K. has recorded 103 cases of a new virus variant that was first identified in India. Scientists are investigating whether it spreads more rapidly or is more resistant to existing vaccines than the original strain.India reported 273,810 new infections on Monday, its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. It has now reported more than 15 million infections, second only to the United States.The Indian Health Ministry also reported 1,619 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 178,769. India has the fourth-highest number of deaths after the U.S., Brazil and Mexico but has a much larger population.New Delhi, where Johnson and Modi had been due to meet, was placed under a weeklong lockdown Monday as the explosive surge in cases pushed the Indian capital\u2019s  system to its limit. The soaring cases and deaths come just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic.Johnson said it was \u201conly sensible\u201d to postpone the trip, given \u201cthe shape of the pandemic there.\" He said he hoped Modi would be able to come to Britain for the Group of 7 summit in June, to which India has been invited as a guest.The strain identified in India, known as B.1.617, is currently designated a \u201cvariant under investigation\u201d by British health authorities, rather than a \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d such as those first identified in southeast England, Brazil and South Africa.Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said \u201cmy assumption from everything I\u2019ve seen is that it will become a variant of concern.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at:https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemichttps://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccinehttps://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/uks-johnson-cancels-india-trip-virus-cases-surge-77160030", "date": "April 19, 2021, 11:19 AM"}
