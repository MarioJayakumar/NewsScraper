Diplomats from the world powers have been shuttling between the Iranian delegation and an American one, which is also in Vienna but not talking directly with the Iranian side.Two expert groups have been brainstorming solutions to the two major issues: The rollback of American sanctions on one hand, and Iran's return to compliance on the other.Now, said Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov, \u201cwe can note with satisfaction that the negotiations (are) entering the drafting stage.\u201d\u201cPractical solutions are still far away, but we have moved from general words to agreeing on specific steps towards the goal,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.From the perception of the E3, the three western European countries involved in the talks, there is \u201cprogress and the will to move forward\" in Vienna, German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said.\u201cOverall, we may be, and hopefully are on a path of rapprochement,\u201d she told reporters in Berlin. \u201cBut there are still many, many open questions.\u201dAlready on Saturday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that Tehran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiations.\u201cWe think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,\u201d Araghchi told Iranian state television. \u201cIt seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.\u201d\u201dThe path is better known, but it will not be easy path,\u201d Araghchi added. \u201cIt does not mean that differences of views have come to the end.\u201dBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told Fox News Sunday that the Vienna talks had been \u201cconstructive,\u201d but he wouldn't give specific details on the proposals.\u201cWhat I will say is that the United States is not going to lift sanctions unless we have clarity and confidence that Iran will fully return to compliance with its obligations under the deal,\u201d he said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted by the country's official IRNA news agency Monday as saying that there was \u201csome progress in the talks, but it doesn't mean the resolution of differences.\u201d\u201cWe think the U.S. administration knows better than anyone that Iran's actions are within the framework of the nuclear deal and they will be halted when the U.S. lifts sanctions and we can verify that,\u201d he said.The ultimate goal of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn\u2019t want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.Challenges also remain outside of the negotiations.An attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel recently struck Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear site, causing an unknown amount of damage. Tehran retaliated by beginning to enrich a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level ever. Inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency also could be disrupted without an agreement.The IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, has also been trying for months to get what it considers a credible explanation from Iran about the discovery of uranium particles at three former undeclared sites in the country.In March, Iran had agreed to host IAEA technical experts for talks on the issue, but instead those discussions started Monday in Vienna, since the Iranian experts were already on hand for the ongoing JCPOA negotiations, the IAEA said.IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has been pushing Iran for answers on the three sites where inspections had revealed traces of uranium of human-made origin, suggesting they were once connected to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.After Iran agreed to have its technical experts talk with those at the IAEA, Grossi said he hoped to \u201ccome to some satisfactory outcome\u201d by the next IAEA board meeting in June.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frank Jordans in Berlin, and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/delegate-progress-iran-nuclear-talks-end-77160292", "date": "April 19, 2021, 11:09 AM"}
