They will spend six months at the orbiting lab, replacing another  crew that\u2019s close to coming home.This will be the first crew flight using a recycled Falcon and Dragon. Both were designed for reuse.The rocket was used to launch the current station crew last November from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The capsule, dubbed Endeavour, also will be making a repeat performance; it carried two test pilots to the space station on SpaceX\u2019s first crew flight last spring.SpaceX refurbished both and added safety upgrades. Most of the capsule is already \u201cflight proven,\u201d company officials noted, except for some new valves, thermal protection covers and parachutes.Kathy Lueders, head of NASA's human exploration office, said it was \u201cmoving\u201d to be on the verge of flying three SpaceX crew flights in 11 months.\u201cLooking back, it\u2019s really, really amazing what both the SpaceX and NASA teams have accomplished,\u201d she said.SpaceX said it must resolve one issue before conducting a test firing at the launch pad this weekend. It appears the company has been loading more liquid oxygen into its first-stage boosters than anticipated, and engineers want to make \u201cextra certain\u201d that poses no safety risks, said Bill Gerstenmaier, a new SpaceX vice president who used to work for NASA.Three of the astronauts are back for their second space station mission: NASA\u2019s Shane Kimbrough, \u2019s Thomas Pesquet and \u2019s Akihiko Hoshide. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur was part of the final Hubble Space Telescope repair team in 2009.For nearly a decade, the only route to the space station for astronauts was on Russian rockets. NASA turned to private companies for taxi service after the space shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX has been shipping cargo to the space station since 2012, using the same kind of rocket and similar capsules, and recycling those parts as well.\u2014\u2014\u2014The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
