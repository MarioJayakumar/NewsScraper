The owners say government promises of compensation for some of their lost revenues aren\u2019t enough to feed their families and keep paying idle workers on payrolls.Operators of gyms, cinemas, museums, theaters and concert halls are complaining they have not been given a firm date when they can open their doors to the public.Premier Mario Draghi says unless the COVID-19 situation quickly improves and vaccination pace picks up, restrictions on dining at eateries will remain at least through this month. After being thwarted from demonstrating outside Parliament, many demonstrators moved to vast People\u2019s Square to continue their protest.\u2014\u2014\u2014LONDON \u2014 An update to the U.K.\u2019s official COVID-19 contact tracing mobile app has been halted because it apparently breached privacy rules laid down by Apple and Google.The update was set to add new features to support the U.K.\u2019s latest easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday.The app, which runs on software jointly developed by Apple and Google, lets people record their visits to places like restaurants and bars by scanning codes. The updated version would ask users who test positive to upload a list of venues where they\u2019ve checked in to help with tracing others with whom they might have come into contact.But the BBC reports that would violate privacy-focused rules that ban the apps from using location data, so Google and Apple blocked the update.\u201c...We remain in discussions with our partners to provide beneficial updates to the app which protect the public,\" the Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement.Apple did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Google referred inquiries to the Department of Health.\u2014\u2014\u2014WASHINGTON \u2013 A top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official says surging vaccines to Michigan would not help the hard-hit state control the latest COVID-19 wave that has strained its hospitals and is raising concerns nationwide, because vaccines take two to six weeks to confer protection.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters during a White House coronavirus briefing Monday that the answer in a crisis situation such as Michigan is facing is to go back to virus control basics and order lockdowns.\u201cI think if we tried to vaccinate our way out of what is happening in Michigan, we would be disappointed that it took so long for the vaccine to work, to actually have an impact,\" Walensky said.Walensky explained that at the same time, diverting vaccines away from other states where the situation isn\u2019t as dire right now could unwittingly seed the ground for future outbreaks elsewhere.Michigan\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has called for the federal government to surge vaccines to her state, but the White House said last week Michigan had not ordered its full allotment of available vaccines. Federal officials say the current population-based formula is still the fairest way to distribute vaccines to states. Whitmer has shied away from ordering lock downs.\u2014\u2014\u2014NEW YORK \u2014 New government reports further highlight the differences in how severely the coronavirus has hit different racial and ethnic groups.One study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Hispanic Americans, Native Americans and Alaska Natives visited hospital emergency departments at a rate 1.7 times higher than white Americans did. That study was based on hospital data from 13 states in the last three months of 2020.A more national report looked at hospitalizations from March through December of last year. It found that in every region of the country, the proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-10 was highest for Hispanic Americans. It found the disparity eased a bit \u2014 but never ended \u2014 in the second half of the year.The researchers said that the narrowing gap does not stem from any reduced risk for Hispanic people or those in other racial or ethnic groups. They wrote that it was more likely due to increasing hospitalizations of white patients during the surge in cases late in the year.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday that racial gaps continue, including in disproportionately lower numbers of Black and Hispanic Americans being vaccinated against the virus compared to white people.\u2014\u2014\u2014HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s leader says fully-vaccinated residents could soon be allowed to form \u201cvaccination bubbles\u201d that would allow socializing in larger groups during the pandemic, as part of incentives to encourage more people to get inoculated.So far, only about 8% of the population has been inoculated since Hong Kong began its vaccination program in late February.But the city\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam said in a news conference Monday that it would soon establish a travel bubble with Singapore as cases have continued to decline since a November 2020 surge.Plans are also in place to allow a limited number of travelers from mainland China to enter Hong Kong without quarantine from mid-May as the mainland has achieved \u201czero infection.\u201dA ban on flights from Britain will also be lifted in May, although travelers will still be required to be quarantined for 21 days at designated hotels. Quarantine restrictions for fully-vaccinated travelers from low-risk and medium-risk countries such as Singapore, New Zealand and Australia could also be reduced.\u2014\u2014\u2014BRUSSELS \u2014 The one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccines have started to be delivered to the European Union on Monday, the first of 55 million doses which are expected to be provided to the bloc before the end of June.EU Commission spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker said the Johnson & Johnson deliveries \u201care indeed on track as agreed.\u201dAbout 105 million vaccine doses were delivered in the first quarter, a bitter disappointment since Anglo-Swedish company AstraZeneca fell about 90 million doses short of an initial commitment of 120 million. The other doses were delivered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna with 65 million and 10 million doses respectively.In the second quarter the EU is counting on 200 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, 35 million of Moderna, 70 million from AstraZeneca and 55 million from Johnson & Johnson.\u2014\u2014\u2014LISBON, Portugal \u2014 The European Union\u2019s crime agency says the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up new sources of revenue for organized crime, from online fraud to fake vaccines and illegal digital content.Europol says \u201ccriminals were quick to adapt \u2026 in order to exploit the fear and anxieties of Europeans and to capitalize on the scarcity of some vital goods during the pandemic.\u201dThe agency says the pandemic acted as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for new online fraud schemes and the sale of counterfeit medical equipment such as face masks, while unlawful sanitary waste treatment and disposal has become a focus of police investigations.Europol\u2019s Serious and Organized Crime Threat Assessment, published every four years and launched in Lisbon, Portugal on Monday, noted one setback for criminals, however: there have been generally fewer house burglaries because many people are working from home during\u2014\u2014\u2014BERLIN \u2014 The German government aims to agree on a bill Tuesday that would shift more powers from state to federal authorities to set pandemic restrictions.The country\u2019s decentralized political system has resulted in an often confusing patchwork of rules and regulations to reduce coronavirus infections in Germany\u2019s 16 states.Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert told reporters on Monday that the goal of the bill is to have a single nationwide rule for all areas where there are more than 100 new weekly cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Currently more than half of Germany\u2019s 400 cities and counties have higher infection rates.Some regions in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein with lower infection rates began reopening open-air dining in cafes and restaurants Monday.The proposed bill would need to be passed by Parliament. Seibert said the government is already in talks with all parties to ensure that happens quickly.\u2014\u2014\u2014SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Health officials in South Korea say Maryland-based Novavax has agreed to a licensing arrangement that will allow a South Korean biotech firm to produce its coronavirus vaccines for later this year.Kwon Deok-cheol, South Korea\u2019s health minister, said Monday that SK Bioscience plans to produce 20 million Novavax shots through September, all of which will be used locally. Production could start as early as June.Food and Drug Safety Minister Kim Gang-lip, who joined Kwon in a news conference, said Novavax\u2019s vaccines are currently being reviewed by regulators in Europe and Britain, but didn\u2019t speculate on when the shots would be approved in major countries.While South Korea hopes to get 150 million doses of coronavirus vaccines this year through bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies and the WHO-backed COVAX program, it has got just over 3 million doses so far.A little over 1.15 million people have received their first doses as of Monday.\u2014\u2014\u2014MADRID \u2014 A Spanish pharmaceutical company says it\u2019s setting up a new production line that would produce millions of Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccine doses on European Union soil later this year.Rovi\u2019s existing facility in southern Spain\u2019s Granada will receive an undisclosed investment to produce the active ingredient of Moderna\u2019s jab, the company announced Monday in a press release.The expected output will be up to 100 million vaccine doses per year starting in the third quarter of 2021, Rovi said, adding that the production will be destined to markets outside the United States.The facility will be the first of its kind in the EU, adding to the production facilities that the Swiss biotech company Lonza has been operating there.Rovi had until now operated production lines to fill vials with Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, but the active component had to be imported into the country.\u2014\u2014\u2014LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to \u201cbehave responsibly\u201d as shops, gyms, hairdressers, restaurant patios and beer gardens reopen after months of lockdown.Monday sees the easing of restrictions that have been in place in England since early January to suppress a surge in coronavirus infections linked to a more transmissible new variant of the virus.Many people were planning outdoor meals and drinks, despite unseasonably cold weather that brought snow to London and many other areas.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 are following their own, broadly similar plans to ease lockdown.Britain has had Europe\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreak, with more than 127,000 confirmed deaths.\u2014\u2014\u2014GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 The Gaza Strip has recorded the highest daily deaths since the coronavirus broke out in the Palestinian enclave.The Health Ministry reported Monday that 17 Palestinians have died from COVID-19, bringing the death toll to 694.Gaza is under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and its Hamas rulers had managed to keep it relatively free of the virus by imposing obligatory quarantine on the few dozens returnees who cross in via Israel or Egypt.But in August, the virus escaped the walls of the isolation centers and spread rapidly. After a significant decrease of infections in February, Hamas removed all precautionary measures and cases resurged.The vaccination rollout is limited. The territory of 2 million people has received vaccines for only 40,000 people, including a shipment via the global COVAX program.\u2014\u2014\u2014TOKYO \u2014 Tokyo has adopted tougher measures against the coronavirus as it struggles to curb the rapid spread of a more contagious variant ahead of the Olympics in a country where less than 1% of people have been vaccinated.Japan expanded its vaccination drive Monday to older residents, with the first shots being given in about 120 selected places around the country.The tougher COVID-19 rules allow Tokyo\u2019s governor to mandate shorter opening hours for bars and restaurants, punish violators and compensate those who comply.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike urged residents to be cautious while vaccinations are in an early stage. \u201cWe are still unarmed as we fight against the resurgence of the infections,\" she said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/latest-hong-kong-ease-travel-social-limits-77023086", "date": "April 12, 2021, 2:11 PM"}
