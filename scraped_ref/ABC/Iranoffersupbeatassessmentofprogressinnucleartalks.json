An American delegation also has been in Vienna, but not talking directly to Iran.Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the talks had entered a new phase, adding that Iran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiations.\u201cWe think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,\u201d Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state television. \u201cIt seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.\u201d\u201dThe path is better known, but it will not be easy path,\u201d Araghchi added. \u201cIt does not mean that differences of views have come to the end.\u201dThe accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, something it says it doesn't want to do. It restricted Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and international sanctions. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the accord, opting for restored and additional American sanctions.Since then, Iran has steadily violated restrictions in the deal, like the amount of enriched uranium that it can stockpile and the purity to which it can be enriched. Tehran\u2019s moves have been calculated to pressure the other participants to do more to offset crippling U.S. sanctions. President Joe Biden has said he wants to bring the U.S. back into the deal but that Iran must reverse its violations.Additional complications have arisen: last weekend, Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility was sabotaged. The attack was widely suspected of being carried out by Israel, which opposes the nuclear deal, though authorities there have not commented.Iran responded by announcing it would increase uranium enrichment to 60% purity, far higher than ever before, and install more advanced centrifuges at the Natanz facility. On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it had verified that Iran had begun the production of uranium hexafluoride enriched up to 60% at Natanz.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday dismissed offers seen so far in Vienna as \u201cnot worth looking at.\u201d Still, he said he had confidence in his negotiators, and Iran's Saturday readout seemed upbeat.Diplomats from the six countries participating told expert-level working groups on sanctions-lifting and nuclear issues \u201cto continue their activities on Saturday afternoon, Sunday and next week\u201d to make further progress, Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted.Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that \u201cprogress has been made in a far from easy task.
