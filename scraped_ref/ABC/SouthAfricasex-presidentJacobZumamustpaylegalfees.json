Zuma had accused them of being biased against him without producing any evidence.\u201cThere is nothing on the record to sustain the inference that the presiding judges in this matter (or at a more generalized level in other matters involving Mr. Zuma) were biased, or that they were not open-minded, impartial, or fair,\" said the ruling.\u201cThe allegations were made with a reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d the court said in the judgment.Zuma is charged with corruption in the country\u2019s controversial 1999 arms procurement deal and the trial is set to begin on May 17.Zuma is accused of receiving bribes through his then financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted on related charges in 2005. Shaik was released on medical parole in 2009.The latest ruling is a setback for Zuma, who faces legal battles on multiple fronts, including a pending court judgment on whether he should be jailed for refusing to testify at a state commission of inquiry which is probing graft while he was president from 2009 to 2018.The commission has heard testimony that Zuma allowed members of the controversial Gupta family to influence his cabinet appointments and state contracts in favor of their businesses.Zuma has refused to testify at the commission, where he has been implicated by several witnesses including people who were Cabinet ministers when he was president.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-africas-president-jacob-zuma-pay-legal-fees-77047862", "date": "April 13, 2021, 1:38 PM"}
