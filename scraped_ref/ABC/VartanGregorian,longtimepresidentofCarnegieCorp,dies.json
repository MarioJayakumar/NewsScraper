He was 87.\u201cThe Corporation has lost a devoted and tireless leader \u2014 an extraordinary champion of education, immigration, and international peace and security, and steward of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s legacy,\u201d the philanthropic group wrote in a         statement on its website Friday. \u201cWe, his colleagues, have lost a mentor, an inspiration, and, for so many, a very dear friend.\u201dBorn to Armenian parents in Tabriz, Iran, Gregorian arrived in the United States in 1956 to study history and the humanities at Stanford University, even though he had only a limited grasp of English.His quest to understand the relationship between the individual and society at large began there, a pursuit that continued as he led The New York Public Library, Brown University and the Carnegie Corporation. In 2004, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civil award.\u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to say \u2018only in America,\u2019 but in my case, that is the truth,\u201d Gregorian said in his         commencement address at Stanford in 2006. \u201cI\u2019m still convinced that while America is not perfect, it is still perfectible.\u201dAuthor of \u201cThe Road to Home: My Life and Times; Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith\u201d and \u201cThe Emergence of Modern Afghanistan, 1880-1946,\u201d Gregorian was hailed around the world as a historian and a philanthropist. He received awards from the French, Italian, Austrian, and Portuguese governments, as well as numerous honorary degrees, including from Brown, Dartmouth, the Juilliard School, the University of Aberdeen and the University of St. Andrews.\u201cWe will remember him most for his immense intellect, his thoughtful generosity, his witty, learned, and sly sense of humor, and his uncanny ability to both inspire and challenge each of us to do our utmost to advance the Corporation\u2019s mission above all else,\u201d said former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, chairman of the Carnegie Corporation's board of trustees. \u201cHe was a man of the world who inspired the world.\u201dGregorian\u2019s American immigrant experience also inspired his life work. In 1986, he was part of the inaugural class awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor that also included Muhammad Ali, Walter Cronkite and Donald J. Trump.\u201cAmerica invested in me and saw me as a citizen,\u201d Gregorian         wrote in 2018 to commemorate July 4 for the Carnegie Corporation. \u201cIt is a debt that I can never fully repay, though I have tried.\u201dFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg credited Gregorian with helping rebuild the city.\u201cAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he came to me and said that something had to be done to save the city\u2019s arts and cultural organizations,\u201d Bloomberg wrote in a statement. \u201cThat was the beginning of a partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Carnegie Foundation that would lead to many other collaborations, including \u2013 most recently \u2013 an effort he helped spearhead to support the city\u2019s arts, cultural, and social service organizations during the pandemic.\u201dGregorian was \u201cconsummate connector, a link in the chain from each of us to the other, and from the past to the future,\" Ford Foundation President Darren Walker said.\u201cAs an immigrant, like Andrew Carnegie before him, Vartan understood what it was like to see America through the eyes of an outsider; as an ardent student and teacher, he was passionate about the transformative power of education,\u201d Walker wrote in tribute. \u201cTogether, all of this and more, shaped his story, career, and legacy\u2014and helped him shape the world for the better.\u201dGregorian is survived by his sons Vah\u00e9 Gregorian and his wife Cindy Billhartz Gregorian of Kansas City, Missouri; Raffi Gregorian of New York; and Dareh Gregorian and his wife Maggie Haberman Gregorian of Brooklyn, New York. He is also survived by five grandchildren\u2014Juan, Maximus, Sophie, Miri, and Dashiell \u2014 and a sister, Ojik Arakelian, of Massachusetts and Iran.Clare Russell Gregorian, his wife of 58 years, died in 2018 after a lengthy struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/vartan-gregorian-longtime-president-carnegie-corp-dies-77125408", "date": "April 16, 2021, 4:37 PM"}
