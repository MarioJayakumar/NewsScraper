These items are usually created with poor quality but sell quickly because of lower costs.Many of these products don't last and end up in the trash.\"The phenomenon of fast fashion -- started from the beginning of the millennium -- has had the objective of feeding this fast-paced ultra-consumerism world that all people want is a huge selection of clothes at affordable pricing with new items popping up every other week,\" Lucia Scarampi, co-founder of slow fashion brand , told \"GMA.\"Countering fast fashion, slow fashion is a business model where clothing is made more mindfully and with more eco-conscious materials. While the production process is longer, it also allows for an opportunity to produce well-designed pieces that are built to last, can be easily repurposed and, in turn, create less waste.\"The slow fashion movement asks all of us, consumers, to change our mindset by quitting mindless shopping and think before acting,\" Scarampi said. \"It also asks us to shift toward shopping habits that are beneficial for the planet.\"Scarampi's company has kept slow fashion at its core by creating items from scratch after they have been ordered, she said.

This is when the label began to realize the world of sustainability was vast and touched every part of the business including human rights, water usage, carbon, recycling and more.In 2009, the Certified B Corporation also created its \"\" program, which allows shoppers to take back clothing to stores, where it can be resold, donated or remade into a new design.While popular fast fashion brands haven't announced plans around increased sustainability within its business model, there are buzzy direct-to-consumer labels, such as Everlane, that are committed to continually finding ways to take a slower, more sustainable approach.\"As the company has grown, our impact on the environment has become bigger, and it is clear that our planet is in an environmental crisis,\" Everlane vice president of design Sonia Martin told \"GMA.\" \"We decided to take responsibility to push for an honest and lower impact supply chain.
