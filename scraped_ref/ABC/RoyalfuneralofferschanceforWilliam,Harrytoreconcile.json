Many will also be watching for any signs of reconciliation between  and the royal family, especially with his elder brother .It will be the first time that Harry comes face-to-face with the royal family since he and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped away from royal duties last March and moved to California with their young son, Archie.While that departure caused a huge rift in the monarchy, family relations took a further dive last month when Harry and Meghan gave a candid interview with U.S. talk show host . Among other revelations, Harry confirmed rumors that he and his brother had been growing apart, saying \u201cthe relationship is \u2018space\u2019 at the moment\u201d \u2014 though he added that \u201ctime heals all things, hopefully.\u201dHarry also told Winfrey that his father, heir to the throne Prince Charles, was not accepting his calls for a time.And the couple threw a bombshell by revealing that an unnamed member of the royal family had expressed concern about \u201chow dark\u201d their child\u2019s skin color might be due to Meghan's biracial heritage. Days after the explosive racism accusations were aired, William shot back, telling reporters that his was \u201cvery much not a racist family.\u201dIn spite of the tensions, Saturday's funeral will almost certainly remind the brothers of their shared grief at another royal funeral more than two decades ago \u2014 when, as young boys, both walked behind their mother Princess Diana's coffin in 1997.On Saturday, Harry, 36, and William, 38, are both expected to join other senior royals and walk behind their grandfather\u2019s coffin, as the funeral procession makes its way through Windsor Castle.Many observers believe that Philip's funeral will provide an ideal opportunity for \u201cThe Firm\u201d to show a united front to the world and for the royal brothers to smooth over tensions. Philip, who had been married to Queen Elizabeth II for more than seven decades, died last week at 99.\u201cThey shared emotion. They share grief at the present time because of the death of their grandfather,\u201d former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed the princes\u2019 guardian after Diana\u2019s death, told the BBC this week. \u201cI hope very much that it is possible to mend any rifts that may exist.\"But Angela Levin, Harry\u2019s biographer, said it would be inappropriate for the royals to talk about their personal issues in the run-up to the funeral, and there may not be time afterward if Harry rushes back to the U.S.\u201cI absolutely think it would be wrong to be all about themselves before the funeral. And I think that it\u2019s wrong to imagine that they\u2019re going to pour out their hearts and give each other a hug, when so much has happened in the year and William has had to take on so much more responsibility,\u201d she told the AP.Penny Junor, another royal biographer, thinks the damage done by the Winfrey interview - especially the racism accusations, which she called \u201cunforgivable\u201d - would be very difficult to come back from.\u201c(Harry) was disrespectful to his father. He talked about a private matter on a global stage. There\u2019s a lot to sort out,\u201d Junor said. Both of the brothers are \u201cvery stubborn people,\u201d she added, and \u201cWilliam will have been really hurt and angry at his brother for the interview.\u201dHarry arrived in the U.K. on Monday and is in quarantine, but he can attend the funeral in line with government rules that make exceptions for such occasions. Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, was advised by her doctor not to make the long trip, officials said.The brothers have had contrasting roles and personalities from birth, though in recent years those differences have increasingly come to the fore.As the younger brother to a future king \u2014 the so-called \u201cspare\u201d to the heir \u2014 Harry had far fewer responsibilities and a reputation as the party prince before serving in the army and settling down in his 30s. He found success and enjoyed popularity in Britain with the Invictus Games, the sporting event he founded for disabled and wounded members of the military.Yet his place in the monarchy became further diminished with the birth of William\u2019s three children, who bumped him down to sixth in line to the throne.It was clear from at least 2019 that Harry wanted a break from the constraints of the monarchy to craft his own narrative. That year Harry and Meghan separated from the Royal Foundation, originally set up as the brothers\u2019 joint charitable venture, so they could have their own platform.The princes\u2019 separate statements this week in tribute to Philip reflected their personalities and differing styles. While William\u2019s stated that he and his wife Kate will \u201ccontinue to do what (Philip) would have wanted and will support The Queen in the years ahead,\u201d Harry\u2019s tone was much more informal and light-hearted.The younger brother praised Philip for being \u201cauthentically himself\u201d and thanked him for his \u201cdedication to Granny.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cWhile I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, \u2018Oh do get on with it\u2019.\u201dStill, Levin and Junor said the brothers had enjoyed an incredibly close bond from childhood, and both were hopeful the time would come for them to reconcile their differences.\u201cHarry said to me when I was interviewing him for my biography, he said that William is the only person he can really trust,\u201d said. \u201cHe felt if he went and met people, he didn\u2019t know if they were liking him for what he was rather than who he was. But they could discuss anything, he and William.\u201dHistorian Ed Owens, who wrote \u201cThe Family Firm: Monarchy, Mass Media and the British Public 1932-1953,\u201d about the royal family\u2019s public relations strategy in the last century, agreed that it was \u201cstill early days\u201d for a royal reconciliation.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any great sort of family get-together or a return to sort of normalcy, sort of pre-Megxit, anytime soon,\u201d he said.\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press Danica Kirka contributed to this report.\u2014\u2014\u2014Read all AP stories about Prince Philip at         https://apnews.com/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/royal-funeral-offers-chance-william-harry-reconcile-77061371", "date": "April 14, 2021, 7:30 AM"}
