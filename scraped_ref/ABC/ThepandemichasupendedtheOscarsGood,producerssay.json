That\u2019s how quickly Steven Soderbergh believes the  will convince viewers that this year\u2019s telecast is different.The concept for the show, which         Soderbergh is producing with Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins, is to treat the telecast not like a TV show but a movie. And he\u2019s convinced he\u2019s got a doozy of an opening scene.\u201cWe\u2019re going to announce our intention immediately,\u201d says Soderbergh. \u201cRight out of the gate, people are going to know: \u2018We\u2019ve got to put our seatbelt on.\u2019\u201dChanging the Academy Awards, a 93-year-old American institution, has typically proven an exercise in futility. Tweaks have been tried along the way, yet the basic format has been stubbornly immutable.But this year, the pandemic has shaken the Oscars like never before. When the broadcast begins April 25 on ABC, there won\u2019t be an audience. The base of the show won\u2019t be the Academy Awards\u2019 usual home, the Dolby Theatre (though the Dolby is still a key location), but Union Station, the airy, Art Deco-Mission Revival railway hub in downtown Los Angeles.For the producers, the challenges of COVID are an opportunity to, finally, rethink the Oscars.\u201cAt any step in the creative process of making a movie, when I ask a question about why something is being done a certain way and the answer is, \u2018Because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s a real red flag for me,\u201d Soderbergh said in a recent Zoom interview with Collins and Sher. \u201cAll of us this year have taken advantage of the opportunity that\u2019s been presented to us to really challenge all the assumptions that go into an award show.\u201dNo matter how good a job they do, ratings are all but certain to fall from         last year\u2019s 23.6 million viewers. Award show viewership         has cratered during the pandemic, and this year\u2019s Oscar nominees \u2014 while widely streamed and more diverse than ever \u2014 lack the kind of buzz generated in a normal year. Soderbergh praises the best-picture nominees as \u201cone of the most auteur-driven set of films.\"\u201cIf the teams in the Super Bowl are from small markets, it\u2019s still a great game, people still care,\u201d says Collins, who produced         The Weeknd\u2019s halftime show at this year's Super Bowl.Collins was also a producer of         last month\u2019s Grammy Awards, a telecast that drew praise for its personal, jam-session feel. That sense of community is something the Oscars want to exude, too.\u201cMy big thing has always been: It\u2019s not intimate. It doesn\u2019t feel personal,\u201d Soderbergh says. \u201cWe\u2019re in a COVID world. It has to be that way. Nominees, guests, presenters. That\u2019s it. Those are the only people in the room. That was just a weird alignment of catastrophe and my personal preoccupation.\u201dThe Oscars, most assuredly, will differ greatly from February\u2019s         largely virtual Golden Globes. The producers have made a stand against both Zoom and casual wear. This is the Oscars, after all; there will be no acceptance speeches made in a hoodie. The producers pressed the nominees to attend in person, with appropriate safety precautions.Some bristled at the academy\u2019s stance \u2014 lockdown regulations are in effect in some countries and cases are persistently high in Europe and elsewhere \u2014 leading to compromise. There will be a hub for nominees in London, and, as of late last week, about a dozen remote satellite hook-ups. Some material will be pre-taped; every nominee has spent 45 minutes with the producers.Soderbergh envisions the broadcast as a three-hour movie, not a webinar. But what does that mean, exactly? If the Oscars are a movie, what kind will it be? From the director of \u201cOcean\u2019s 11\u201d and \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d should we expect a heist film?\u201cIt\u2019s going to feel like a movie in that there\u2019s an overarching theme that\u2019s articulated in different ways throughout the show. So the presenters are essentially the storytellers for each chapter,\u201d says Soderbergh. \u201cWe want you to feel like it wasn't a show made by an institution. We want you to feel like you\u2019re watching a show that was made by a small group of people that really attacked everything that feels generic or unnecessary or insincere. That\u2019s the kind of intention when I watch shows like this that is missing for me. A voice. It needs to have a specific voice.\u201dTechnically, the broadcast will have a more widescreen look and a more cinematic approach to the music. (Questlove is music director.) Presenters are considered the ensemble cast. One thing you won\u2019t see, says Collins, is standard banter before an award is handed out.\u201cWhen you see cast members go up to give awards, you\u2019ll see a connection,\u201d Collins says. \u201cIt won\u2019t be two people walking up that just met in the greenroom who are struggling to stick with the teleprompter.\u201dIt\u2019s undeniably a lot to pull off, with ever-fluctuating COVID-19 conditions and restrictions. The logistics are \u201cmind-numbing,\u201d Soderbergh says. The egos, a whole other fascinating component. \u201cOh, it\u2019s a chapter for the memoir, for sure,\u201d he says. But the show is coming together. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty amped,\u201d he says.The role of Academy Awards savior is an unlikely one for Soderbergh, who         dramatically bid Hollywood goodbye eight years ago. His criticism then was that the studios weren\u2019t innovating and that movies had drifted from the cultural center. But after         returning to moviemaking in a restless sprint of adventurous, conceptually daring films (some         shot on iPhones, one         made on an ocean liner ), Soderbergh helped lead the industry back to production during the pandemic, mapping out safety protocols \u2014 including the kinds of testing and quarantining that will be in effect for attending nominees next week.The Oscars are an annual meeting, of sorts, for Hollywood \u2014 a moment of reflection, aspiration and backslapping for the industry. This year\u2019s awards, postponed by two months, follow a punishing pandemic year for the industry         that saw movie theaters shuttered and streaming services proliferate. Soderbergh hopes the Oscars will be cathartic, and a shot in the arm for Hollywood.\u201cThe cliche when you go into to pitch a movie is to say it\u2019s about hope and scope,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is kind of what we want to do, to show what\u2019s possible.\u201dThat includes an affectionate celebration of each category\u2019s craft and nominees.\u201cSnark is something that we didn\u2019t want,\u201d says Sher, the veteran producer of \u201cGet Shorty,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and Soderbergh films like \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d \u201cInstead of looking at it from the outside in with a high degree of cynicism and stark, we\u2019re pulling the curtain back and letting them into our community. There are a lot of misperceptions about the business. It\u2019s a predominantly blue-color industry, with unions.\u201dOn Oscar night, Soderbergh \u2014 who typically serves as his own cinematographer under the alias Peter Andrews \u2014 plans to be in the production truck alongside the show\u2019s director, Glenn Weiss.\u201cThere\u2019s been so much resistance to make any big moves, but at least what we\u2019ll have done, coming out the other end, is give the academy, the network and the viewers some real information about what they like and what they don\u2019t like because we made some big moves,\u201d Soderbergh says. \u201cThat means it will evolve, and it needs to evolve.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at         http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/pandemic-upended-oscars-good-producers-77114081", "date": "April 16, 2021, 9:07 AM"}
