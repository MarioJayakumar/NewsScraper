The measures are to remain through May 11.The status was also raised for Kyoto in western Japan and the southern island prefecture of Okinawa and is to last through May 5, the end of Japan\u2019s \u201cGolden Week\u201d holidays, to discourage traveling.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has asked residents to avoid nonessential trips and practice social distancing. She asked bars and restaurants in many areas to close at 8 p.m and urged residents to be cautious while vaccinations are in an early stage.\u201cWe are still unarmed as we fight against the resurgence of the infections,\u201d Koike said. \u201cPlease follow the guidelines.\u201dHealth officials also will patrol bars and restaurants to ensure safety measures are observed, and testing will be increased at elderly care facilities.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga visited a vaccination center in Tokyo\u2019s western suburbs and pledged to do all he can for a smooth and swift operation.Japan has managed the pandemic better than the United States and many countries in Europe, with fewer than half a million cases and 9,400 deaths since the pandemic began. But it has seen an uptick in recent weeks and on Sunday reported 2,762 cases across the country.Vaccinations, however, have lagged behind many other nations due to limited supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, the only one approved in Japan. Japan so far entirely relies on imports of the shot. Just over 1 million people in Japan have received the first of two vaccine doses.Inoculations started in mid-February for medical workers, and the campaign will focus on older people through the summer. The rest of the population is likely to have to wait until about July or later, making it almost impossible for Japan to reach so-called herd immunity before the Tokyo Olympics begin on July 23.Approval is pending for shots by AstraZeneca and Moderna. Japan has confirmed orders in for 344 million doses of  to be provided this year \u2014 enough for its entire population.Sourcing enough imported vaccines is a major concern due to supply shortages and export controls in Europe, where those vaccines come from.

Fifteen cities in the six prefectures, including downtown Tokyo, are now under elevated virus measures.Tokyo's return to the alert status Monday underscores the difficulty of balancing anti-virus measures and the economy.
