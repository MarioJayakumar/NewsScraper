Andy Beshear says there are lessons to be drawn from the COVID-19 pandemicFRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday there are lessons to be drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 from a greater sense of shared responsibility to the outsized role social media plays in a crisis.The first-term Democrat, who intends to run for reelection in 2023 in a state Republicans have dominated in recent years, downplayed questions about the political consequences of restrictions he imposed across many aspects of life in Kentucky to slow the virus\u2019s spread.Beshear remains popular in the state but is likely to face a tough political battle in Republican-trending Kentucky. Looking ahead to his reelection bid, he said that if his record in fighting the virus generates \u201cnegative repercussions\" politically then \u201cI\u2019m ready for them.\u201d But he added, \u201cIf it comes with positive outcomes, OK. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it.\u201dAnd he's already looking beyond the pandemic that has claimed more than 6,200 lives in Kentucky, a state of more than 4 million.The state's post-pandemic economy is \u201cset to take off,\u201d Beshear said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. He pointed to recent discussions with business prospects regarding potential billion-dollar-plus projects in Kentucky, noting that there's more interest in \u201clarger projects and expansions than at any point in my lifetime.\"Despite the divisions over mask wearing and restrictions on a cross-section of activities, the fight against the  \u201chas taught us how connected we all are in what we thought was a disconnected world,\u201d Beshear said.For an activist governor who calls health care a basic human right, Beshear said that shared responsibility could have big consequences for future U.S. policies.\u201cIn a world that sometimes said \u2018you need to go out and do the best for just yourself and your family,\u2019 now we know that our decisions have impacts on the people around us,\u201d he said. \"In the pandemic ... every choice we made could have a positive or negative impact on the health \u2014 or even the life and death \u2014 of an individual.\u201cAnd now that we have spent a year and a couple months living for each other, and sacrificing for each other, I think we\u2019ve got a chance to be better people coming out of this,\u201d Beshear added.Beshear \u2014 who has faced protests, lawsuits and impeachment petitions over his virus-related executive actions \u2014 criticized the role of \u201cout of control\u201d social media platforms in promoting \u201csensationalism\u201d that in turn grabbed headlines during the pandemic. Those social media sites can make \u201ca small group appear a lot larger than it is,\u201d the governor said.Beshear has faced steady criticism and occasional protests over his actions. Armed protesters gathered near the governor's home last year and then hanged Beshear in effigy in a tree near the State Capitol. The event was billed as a rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms, but turned into a protest against the governor\u2019s virus restrictions.Earlier this year, Beshear pointed to a social media video that warned the governor risked being struck down by God unless he rescinded a COVID-19 order from applying to churches. The video showed a gun behind the man.Beshear faced petitions this year seeking his impeachment. A Republican-led legislative panel recommended that the governor not face removal from office and the matter died after that.The governor said Wednesday that he separated virus-related decisions from politics, and insisted that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Kentuckians know his actions were necessary. That includes people who voted against him when he ousted Republican incumbent Matt Bevin in 2019.\"I can\u2019t tell you how many times somebody has come up to me and said, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t vote for you and I don\u2019t apologize for it, but you\u2019ve done a good job and I appreciate it.\u2019 I get more of those every day than we ever see people at a protest,\u201d Beshear said.In two years, Beshear said he hopes the dominant issues are \u201chow we\u2019re doing then.\u201d\u201cIf in 2023 when I\u2018m up, if people aren\u2019t thinking about the pandemic any more, then I\u2019ve done my job,\" he said. \"Now whether that\u2019s good or bad politically, again I can live with that. If it\u2019s us defeating this virus this year, which I want to do, if it\u2019s us defeating the virus this summer, which I hope we do, and that means it\u2019s no longer on people\u2019s minds by that point, good for us.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/interview-kentucky-governor-sees-lessons-pandemic-77079119", "date": "April 14, 2021, 7:33 PM"}
