But his religious background and interests were more varied than his conventional role might suggest.Born into the Greek royal family as Prince Philip of  and Denmark, he was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church. His father was exiled and his family left Greece when Philip was very young. He became an Anglican when he married Elizabeth, who as queen is supreme governor of the Church of England.In the 1960s, he helped set up St. George\u2019s House, a religious study center at the royal family\u2019s Windsor Castle seat, where Philip would join clergy, academics, businesspeople and politicians to discuss the state of the world.He was a regular visitor to Mount Athos, a monastic community and religious sanctuary in Greece, and was a long-time patron of the Templeton Prize, a lucrative award for contribution to life\u2019s \u201cspiritual dimension\u201d whose winners include Mother Teresa.Philip's longstanding alism, which saw him serve as patron of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, was connected to his faith. He organized a 1986 summit in Assisi, Italy where representatives of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism pledged to protect the environment. Philip said at the time that \u201ca new and powerful alliance has been forged between the forces of religion and the forces of conservation.\u201dBlunt-spoken and quick-witted, Philip also was known for making remarks that could be deeply offensive, some of them sexist and racist. But former Archbishop of York John Sentamu, who was born in Uganda, said those who saw Philip as a bigot were wide of the mark.\u201cIf somebody challenged him, you would enter into an amazing conversation,\u201d Sentamu told the BBC. \u201cThe trouble was that because he was the Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of the queen, people had this deference.\u201cI\u2019m sure sometimes he regretted some of those phrases, but in the end it\u2019s a pity that people saw him as somebody who makes gaffes,\u201d Sentamu said. \u201cBehind those gaffes was an expectation of a comeback, but nobody came back, and the gaffe, unfortunately, stayed.\u201dInderjit Singh, a prominent British Sikh leader, said Philip had a strong knowledge of Sikhism and \u201ccontributed to the understanding and harmony between differing faith communities.\u201d\u201cHe recognized what we should all recognize....We are all of one common humanity,\u201d Singh said.Philip\u2019s faith may have been partly a legacy of his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who established an order of nuns, sheltered Jews in Nazi-occupied Greece during World War II and is buried below a Russian Orthodox church in east Jerusalem.\u201cI suspect that it never occurred to her that her action was in any way special,\u201d Philip said on a 1994 trip to Israel, where he visited his mother\u2019s grave. \u201cShe was a person with deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a totally human action to fellow human beings in distress.\u201dHis interests in religion and ecology have been passed on to his eldest son, . The heir to the throne is a strong environmentalist who has said he wants to be \u201cdefender of faiths\u201d when he takes the throne, rather than the monarch\u2019s official title as defender of the Anglican faith", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/religious-leaders-recall-prince-philips-spiritual-curiosity-77003847", "date": "April 11, 2021, 8:35 AM"}
