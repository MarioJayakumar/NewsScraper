Both sides sent government planes Monday to take the envoys and their families home.Pavel Zeman, the Czech prosecutor general, said the ammunition targeted was mostly meant to be sent to an arms dealer in Bulgaria and be intentionally exploded after delivery. The 2014 depot blast in the town of Vrbetice killed two people.\u201cThe explosion was not supposed to occur on Czech Republic\u2019s territory,\u201d Zeman said.Zeman said the two Russian suspects were using false identities on passports from Tajikistan and Moldova when they booked a visit to the depot. They stayed in Prague and the eastern city of Ostrava, about two-hour drive from the depot, which is located in the eastern Czech Republic.The suspects also used Russian passports to travel to the Czech Republic.Their names and photos matched two Russians whom British authorities charged in absentia in 2018 with trying to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Soviet nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury.\u201cThe two were identified as the attackers in Salisbury in 2018,\u201d Zeman said.Zeman said because the investigation has not been completed, authorities cannot reveal more details about the case and rejected Babis\u2019 request to publish them. Babis said his government is consider demanding compensation for damages from the Russians.Czech Republic\u2019s Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also the acting foreign minister, said Monday that the Russian expulsion of Czech diplomats effectively paralyzed the Czech Embassy in Moscow.\u201cWe had to expect that to happen but the Czech Republic has not done anything wrong,\u201d Hamacek said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who are the victims of the Russian actions.\u201dBabis said the Czechs will \u201ccertainly\u201d respond to what is seen as a disproportionate Russian move.The Czech government also decided not to allow the Russian state-controlled Rosatom nuclear corporation from participating in a tender for the planned construction of a nuclear reactor at its Dukovany nuclear plant.The Czech intelligence services have repeatedly warned against allowing Russian and Chinese companies to bid in the multibillion-dollar tender, saying they pose security risk due to links to their respective governments.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/czech-russian-envoys-fly-home-amid-depot-explosion-77170632", "date": "April 19, 2021, 2:46 PM"}
