I had to go outside for a few minutes to take a breather.\u201dThe Romanian movie \u201cCollective\u201d is nominated for two Oscars \u2014 best foreign film and best documentary feature. It follows a team of investigative journalists searching for the truth in the wake of the Oct. 30, 2015, fire at the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest. It killed 65 people \u2014 27 on the night, the others in the months that followed, including a suicide victim more than 18 months later. It left Ursuleanu with severe burns and her recovery has taken years.The fire was the result of an on-stage pyrotechnics show gone wrong, but the journalists were not looking into the causes of the blaze. Instead, they were looking at Romania's health care system, and what they revealed was decades of deep-rooted corruption, a heavily politicized system scarily lacking in care.For instance, they discovered that for a decade watered-down disinfectants had been knowingly sold to around 350 state hospitals.A doctor in the aftermath of the fire described the situation as a \u201cbiological bomb,\u201d and while health officials said that burn patients were receiving care on a par with what they would receive in Germany, burns victims were dying of infections in bacteria-riddled hospitals.\u201cI was shocked, honestly I was shocked. I couldn\u2019t believe the level of corruption in our health care system,\u201d said Ursuleanu.Although she survived, her recovery was far from straightforward.\u201cMy life changed a lot after the fire, especially the first three years. I had loads of operations, most of them on my arms, but also on my face and my throat\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve practically had to learn over the last five years how to use my arms independently, to take care of myself \u2014 loads of things changed.\u201dThe gripping but hard-to-watch film has won a host of awards since its release in 2019. If it wins an Oscar, it will be the first Romanian film in history to do so. \u201cThe fact that a film that is not a crowd-pleaser got two nominations is a pleasant surprise,\u201d the film's director, Alexander Nanau, told The Associated Press.\"It responds to a deep-seated fear that many people have had since 2016 when so many populists took over and started to dismantle institutions, that democracies aren\u2019t safe anymore \u2014 that the power structures are so sick that everybody can become a victim,\u201d the 41-year-old said.Nanau also recalled the screening of his film for the fire survivors and their families, including Ursuleanu. \u201cIt was the toughest screening I ever had with a film because their reception was the most important \u2014 we felt the film was a tribute to them.\"Almost six years have passed since the fire, which toppled the government following huge street protests where demonstrators chanted \u201cCorruption Kills.\u201d Although 13 people have been sentenced in criminal cases, including the nightclub owners, fire safety inspectors, and an incumbent Bucharest mayor \u2014 appeals are still being heard so no one is yet serving a sentence.This week, a tribunal at Bucharest's Court of Appeal proposed to reduce the charges against six people sentenced over the disaster.\u201cNone of the victims has received any compensation from the Romanian state for what it did to them ... the fact that their lives were destroyed by corruption and state institutions. The doctors, the minister of health at the time, and the health care officials at the top of that manipulation should face trials,\" Nanau said.Decades of systemic corruption and widespread apathy in Romania's health care system created many difficult-to-watch scenes in \u201cCollective.\u201d In one case, video footage provided by a whistleblower revealed maggots crawling over a burn victim's open wound.Catalin Tolontan, the protagonist who heads the journalistic investigation at the heart of the film, cuts a philosophical figure. \u201cI believe the discussion is not about the press, it\u2019s about the citizens together with the press \u2026 holding the leaders to account. As the historian Timothy Snyder said: \u2018To abandon facts is to abandon freedom,\u2019\u201d he said.The international success of the movie, he says, can in some cases provide comfort for those who lost loved ones to the fire . He quotes a victim's father who told the journalist: \u201cJustice has been served for my 18-year-old son because the film has reached such a wide audience.\"Tolontan also pointed out that the large majority of whistleblowers \u2014 which only grew after his investigation, and after the movie's release \u2014 were women.\u201cIn most Eastern European societies, women are the ones who preoccupy themselves with health care in the families \u2014 they are on the front line with corruption, incompetence, and the disorganization in hospitals \u2014 they are the first ones that suffer and that\u2019s why they were the first ones to talk.\"\u201cCollective\u201d has reverberated globally since its release, with Barack Obama including it on his list of best films of 2020, and on Thursday the whistleblower Edward Snowden urged people on social media to \u201cwatch this film.\u201dUrsuleanu says she will stay up late to watch the Oscar awards ceremony, and that she hopes the film can lead to \u201csome positive changes in society and that \u2018Collective\u2019 won\u2019t be a subject that people easily forget.\u201dBut ultimately, she hopes that \"justice will take place in the court room.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/oscar-nominated-romanian-film-reveals-health-care-failings-77113378", "date": "April 16, 2021, 7:23 AM"}
