In 2018, ING paid 775 million euros ($897 million) t         o settle a huge money laundering case.Prosecutors said Monday that the ABN AMRO's breaches are attributed to the bank, but added that their investigation also identified three former members of its board who \u201cpresumably are effectively responsible\u201d for the violations. It did not identify the three and said investigations are continuing into whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute them.However, in Denmark Danske Bank said its CEO Chris Vogelzang had resigned after being named as one of the suspects. Gerrit Zalm, a former Dutch finance minister and ex-ABN AMRO board member, also quit Danske Bank's board.Vogelzang said he was surprised by the Dutch probe.\u201cI left ABN AMRO more than four years ago and am comfortable with the fact that I managed my management responsibilities with integrity and dedication,\u201d he said. \u201cMy status as a suspect does not imply that I will be charged.\u201dABN AMRO said in a statement that it \u201cdeeply regrets the situation and recognizes the seriousness of the matter, and that it has fallen short in the fulfilment of its role as gatekeeper aimed at combatting money laundering.\u201dCEO Robert Swaak added: \u201cThis is unacceptable and we take full responsibility for this.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Jan M.
