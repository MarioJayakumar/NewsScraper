In the second, Gastelum had some success with his boxing and straight left hands, but Whittaker landed some nice jabs and counters. Whittaker rocked Gastelum again with a combination in the third, a round in which Gastelum had some success early.Whittaker landed two nice uppercuts in the fourth round and got right up from a Gastelum takedown.
