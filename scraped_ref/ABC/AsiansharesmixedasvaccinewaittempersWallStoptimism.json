A top ruling party official suggested the possibility of canceling the Tokyo Olympics, set to start in July, if infections continue to surge.Prakash Sakpal and Nicholas Mapa, senior economists for ING, said the markets are watching the meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and President Joe Biden, set for the weekend, data from China, including GDP and retail sales, as well as for further news on the pandemic.\u201cAsian markets will likely track gains overnight with optimism driven by positive US data highlighted by retail sales.

Only energy and financial companies closed lower. Bond yields fell.The rally came as investors welcomed a suite of encouraging economic reports showing how hungry Americans are to spend again, how fewer workers are losing their jobs and how much fatter corporate profits are getting.Expectations are very high on Wall Street that the economy \u2014 and thus corporate profits \u2014 are in the midst of exploding out of the cavern created by the pandemic, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations and massive support from the U.S. government and Federal Reserve. New data on retail sales and jobless claims Thursday helped bolster the view that the economic recovery is accelerating.\u201cAnother day, another record,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cThe  continues to validate the optimistic forecasts from last year, which predicted a strong economy that was driven by consumers emerging from their homes, emboldened by vaccinations or by a belief that the worst of COVID was behind us.\u201dThe S&P 500 rose 45.76 points to 4,170.42, surpassing its previous record high of 4,141.59 set on Tuesday.

It's also the lowest number since the pandemic.Adding to the optimism, more big U.S. companies reported even healthier profits for the first three months of 2021 than analysts had forecast.
