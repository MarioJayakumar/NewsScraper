Another explosion of 13 tons of ammunition occurred in the depot on Dec. 3 of that same year.Hundreds had to be evacuated from nearby villages after those explosions.\u201cThe United States stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic,\u201d Jennifer Bachus, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. embassy in Prague, said. \u201cWe appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.\u201dThe Czech announcement came two days after the U.S. said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year\u2019s presidential  and the hacking of federal agencies.Babis said President Milos Zeman, who is known for his pro-Russian views, has been informed about the development and has \u201cexpressed absolute support for us.\u201dHe said the investigation into the case has not yet been completed but thanked the country's security forces for their \u201cprofessional job.\"The announcement sent a shockwave across the country, with the politicians from the government parties and opposition united in condemning the Russian move.\u201cIt's an act of state terrorism,\" said Petr Fiala, the head of the opposition Civic Democratic Party.Jiri Sedivy, former chief the Czech military's general staff, said the Czechs have to response \u201cresolutely\u201d to the Russian action.\u201c\u201dIt was an obvious military attack on our sovereign territory,\" Sedivy told the Czech public television.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said her country would answer the Czech move.\u201cPrague is well aware of what will follow such tricks,\u201d Zakharova was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency.Hamacek said the the case will significantly harm Czech-Russian relations. He said the country's allies in NATO and the European Union have been informed about the findings and \u201cwe\u2019ve asked for their support.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in a similar situation like Britain in the attempted poisoning case in Salisbury in 2018,\u201d Hamacek said, without elaborating.Britain expelled dozens of Russian diplomats after Russian agents used a Soviet-era nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter who were living in the English city of Salisbury.At the same time, the Czech police's organized crime unit on Saturday published photos of two foreign citizens who visited the country, including the Zlin region where Vrbetice is located, between Oct. 11 and Oct. 16 in 2014 and asked the public for any information about them.The two were using Russian passports and were identified as Alexander Petrov, 41, and Ruslan Boshirov, 43. Petrov and Boshirov were charged in absentia by Britain in 2018 for trying to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with the Soviet nerve agent Novichok.The Czech police said the two men were also using passports issued by Moldova for Nicolai Popa and a passport issued by Tajikistan for Ruslan Tabarov.They said the two also visited the capital of Prague and another northeastern Czech region.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/czechs-expel-18-russians-huge-depot-explosion-2014-77140530", "date": "April 17, 2021, 4:37 PM"}
