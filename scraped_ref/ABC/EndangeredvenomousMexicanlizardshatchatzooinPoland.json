Popular Mexican belief also says they can provoke lighting with their tails.Adult males can grow to 90 centimeters (35 inches) and weigh up to 4 kilograms (9 pounds).Three Mexican beaded lizards previously hatched at the zoo in 2016 and were transferred to the Singapore Zoo in 2018.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/endangered-venomous-mexican-lizards-hatch-zoo-poland-77166889", "date": "April 19, 2021, 11:42 AM"}
