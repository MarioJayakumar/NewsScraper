Given the test results and the overall state of his , it was decided to transfer him here. In the evening, he became significantly worse,\u201d Liptser said. While Navalny was able to meet with him Monday, he continued his hunger strike and \u201cin general his look indicates he is really unwell,\" the lawyer added.Russia's state penitentiary service FSIN did not report the decision to transfer Navalny until Monday morning and a statement it released said he had agreed to take vitamin therapy.Liptser said he didn't have enough time with his client to confirm that: \u201cThey were searching him ahead of our meeting longer than our meeting had lasted. He was outraged by this. Therefore, we couldn\u2019t discuss anything, apart from what has happened to him.\"The prison service statement said Navalny\u2019s condition was deemed \u201csatisfactory.\u201d But the opposition leader's physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said Saturday that test results provided by the family show Navalny has sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, as well as heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidney function.\u201cOur patient could die at any moment,\u201d he said in a Facebook post.Reports about his rapidly declining health drew international outrage and calls urging Russian authorities to give adequate medical help to Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponent. European Union foreign ministers         were assessing the bloc\u2019s strategy toward Russia  in wake of the news.White House press secretary Jen Psaki called for his release and that he \u201cmust be treated humanely,\u201d adding that U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan discussed Navalny with Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian Security Council.\u201cWhat happens to Mr. Navalny in the custody of the Russian government is the responsibility of the Russian government, and that they will be held accountable by the international community,\" she added.Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin \u2014 an accusation Russian officials have rejected. His arrest triggered massive protests across Russia, the biggest show of defiance in recent years. Soon after, a court ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on a 2014 embezzlement conviction that the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be \u201carbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.\u201dNavalny began a hunger strike to protest the refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.In response to the alarming news about Navalny\u2019s health, his team has called for a nationwide rally Wednesday, the same day that Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address. According to a website dedicated to the protests, demonstrations were being planned in 77 Russian cities as of Monday afternoon.The Interior Ministry in a statement urged Russians not to take part in unauthorized rallies, citing coronavirus risks and alleging that some \u201cdestructive-minded\u201d participants might provoke unrest. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said police will treat any unauthorized protests as illegal. In the past, security forces have violently broken up demonstrations.Already, Russian authorities have taken their crackdown on Navalny\u2019s allies and supporters to a new level, with the Moscow prosecutor\u2019s office last week petitioning a court to label as extremist groups Navalny\u2019s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices.Human rights advocates say if that happens, both the foundation and the regional offices would be outlawed, paralyzing their operations, and those who work for either could be prosecuted. Donating money to the groups \u2014 something thousands of Russians have done regularly in recent years \u2014 would also become a criminal offense punishable by prison.For now, several Navalny allies have dismissed as insufficient the move to move him to the prison hospital. Ivan Zhdanov, head of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption, tweeted that the transfer takes Navalny merely to another \u201ctormenting colony, just with a big in-patient facility, where gravely ill are being transferred.\u201dDr. Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of the Navalny-backed Alliance of Doctors union and also his personal physician, noted that it was \u201cnot a hospital where a diagnosis can be determined and treatment (can be) prescribed for his ailments,\u201d but rather \u201ca prison where tuberculosis is being treated.\u201dShe again called for the prison to let her and other physicians see him, but Liptser said that prison officials told Navalny he won't be allowed a visit from \u201ccivilian\u201d doctors.Since last month, the politician has been serving his sentence in a penal colony notorious for its harsh conditions.Navalny has complained about being sleep-deprived because guards conduct hourly checks on him at night, and he said he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs within weeks of his transfer to the colony. His demands for a visit from an independent \u201ccivilian\u201d physician were rebuffed by prison officials, and he began the hunger strike March 31.In a wry message Friday from prison, Navalny said authorities threatened to force-feed him \u201cimminently,\u201d using a \u201cstraitjacket and other pleasures.\u201dThe French newspaper Le Monde on Friday published a letter to Putin signed by dozens of cultural figures \u2014 including writers Salman Rushdie and Mario Vargas Llosa, singer Patti Smith and actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Kristin Scott Thomas \u2014 urging him to give Navalny access to proper medical care.On Monday, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, reiterated her calls for Navalny's release and to \u201cgive him full access to medical care in light of his serious health deterioration.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/jailed-kremlin-critic-navalny-moved-hospital-77159989", "date": "April 19, 2021, 4:34 PM"}
