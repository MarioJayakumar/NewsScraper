Because its products are a de facto monoculture in government and industry \u2014 with more than 85% market share \u2014 federal lawmakers are insisting that Microsoft swiftly upgrade security to what they say it should have provided in the first place, and without fleecing taxpayers.Seeking to assuage concerns, Microsoft this past week offered all federal agencies a year of \u201cadvanced\u201d security features at no extra charge. But it also seeks to deflect blame, saying it is customers who do not always make security a priority.Risks in Microsoft's foreign dealings also came into relief when the Biden administration         imposed sanctions Thursday on a half-dozen Russian IT companies it said support Kremlin hacking. Most prominent was Positive Technologies, which was among more than 80 companies that Microsoft has supplied with early access to data on vulnerabilities detected in its products. Following the sanctions announcement, Microsoft said Positive Tech was no longer in the program and removed its name from a list of participants on its website.The SolarWinds hackers took full advantage of what George Kurtz, CEO of top cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, called \u201csystematic weaknesses\u201d in key elements of Microsoft code to mine at least nine U.S. government agencies \u2014 the departments of Justice and Treasury, among them \u2014 and more than 100 private companies and think tanks, including software and telecommunications providers.The SolarWinds hackers' abuse of Microsoft\u2019s          identity and access architecture  \u2014 which validates users' identities and grants them access to email, documents and other data \u2014 did the most dramatic harm, the nonpartisan Atlantic Council think tank said         in a report.  That set the hack apart as \u201ca widespread intelligence coup.\u201d In nearly every case of post-intrusion mischief, the intruders \"silently moved through Microsoft products \u201cvacuuming up emails and files from dozens of organizations.\u201dThanks in part to the carte blanche that victim networks granted the infected Solarwinds network management software in the form of administrative privileges, the intruders could move laterally across them, even jump among organizations. They used it to         sneak into the cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes and to target customers of         Mimecast, an email security company.The campaign\u2019s \u201challmark\u201d was the intruders\u2019 ability to impersonate legitimate users and create counterfeit credentials that let them grab data stored remotely by Microsoft Office, the acting director of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency, Brandon Wales, told a mid-March congressional hearing. \u201cIt was all because they compromised those systems that manage trust and identity on networks,\u201d he said.Microsoft President Brad Smith told a February congressional hearing that just 15% of victims were compromised through an         authentication vulnerability first identified in 2017 \u2014 allowing the intruders to impersonate authorized users by minting the rough equivalent of counterfeit passports.Microsoft officials stress that the SolarWinds update was not always the entry point; intruders sometimes took advantage of vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and victims\u2019 lack of multi-factor authentication. But critics say the company took security too lightly. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., verbally pummeled Microsoft for not supplying federal agencies with a level of \u201cevent logging\u201d that, if it had not detected the SolarWinds hacking in progress, would at least have provided responders with a record of where the intruders were and what they saw and removed.\u201cMicrosoft chooses the default settings in the software it sells, and even though the company knew for years about the hacking technique used against U.S. government agencies, the company did not set default logging settings to capture information necessary to spot hacks in progress,\u201d Wyden said. He was not the only federal lawmaker who complained.When Microsoft on Wednesday announced a         year of free security logging for federal agencies, for which it normally charges a premium, Wyden was not appeased.\u201cThis move is far short of what\u2019s needed to make up for Microsoft\u2019s recent failures,\u201d he said in a statement. \"The government still won\u2019t have access to important security features without handing over even more money to the same company that created this cybersecurity sinkhole.\u201dRep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., had pressed Smith in February on the security logging upsell, comparing it to making seat belts and air bags options in cars when they should be standard. He commended Microsoft for the one-year reprieve, but said a longer-term conversation is due about it \u201cnot being a profit center.\" He said \"this buys us a year.\u201dEven the highest level of logging doesn't prevent break-ins, though. It only makes it easier to detect them.And remember, many security professionals note, Microsoft         was itself compromised by the SolarWinds intruders, who got access to some of its source code \u2014 its crown jewels. Microsoft\u2019s full suite of security products \u2014 and some of the industry's most skilled cyber-defense practitioners \u2014 had failed to detect the ghost in the network. It was alerted to its own breach by FireEye, the cybersecurity firm that first detected the hacking campaign in mid-December.The intruders in the unrelated hack of Microsoft Exchange email servers disclosed in March \u2014 blamed on Chinese spies \u2014 used wholly different infection methods. But they gained immediate high-level access to users' email and other info.Across the industry, Microsoft\u2019s investments in security are widely acknowledged. It is often first to identify major cybersecurity threats, its visibility into networks is so great. But many argue that as the chief supplier of security solutions for its products, it needs to be more mindful about how much it should profit off defense.\u201cThe crux of it is that Microsoft is selling you the disease and the cure,\u201d said Marc Maiffret, a cybersecurity veteran who built a career finding vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and has a new startup in the works called BinMave.Last month, Reuters reported that a $150 million payment to Microsoft for a \u201csecure cloud platform\u201d was included in a draft outline for spending the $650 million appropriated for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in last month's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief act.A Microsoft spokesperson would not say how much, if any, of that money it would be getting, referring the question to the cybersecurity agency. An agency spokesman, Scott McConnell, would not say either. Langevin said he didn't think a final decision has been made.In the budget year ending in September, the federal government spent more than half a billion dollars on Microsoft software and services.Many security experts believe Microsoft's single sign-on model, emphasizing user convenience over security, is ripe for retooling to reflect a world where state-backed hackers now routinely run roughshod over U.S. networks.Alex Weinert, Microsoft's director of identity security, said it offers          various ways for customers to strictly limit users\u2019 access  to what they need to do their jobs. But getting customers to go along can be difficult because it often means abandoning three decades of IT habit and disrupting business. Customers tend to configure too many accounts with the broad global administrative privileges that allowed the SolarWinds campaign abuses, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only way they can do it, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dIn 2014-2015, lax restrictions on access helped Chinese spies steal sensitive personal data on         more than 21 million current, former and prospective federal employees from the Office of Personnel Management.Curtis Dukes was the National Security Agency's head of information assurance at the time.The OPM shared data across multiple agencies using Microsoft's authentication architecture, granting access to more users than it safely should have, said Dukes, now the managing director for the nonprofit Center for Internet Security.\u201cPeople took their eye off the ball.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/solarwinds-hacking-campaign-puts-microsoft-hot-seat-77135273", "date": "April 18, 2021, 12:32 AM"}
