The company responded, the Irish agency said, suggesting it wasn't satisfied with the answers.Facebook said it\u2019s \u201ccooperating fully\u201d with the investigation.The company has previously downplayed the problem,         saying  \u201cmalicious actors\" didn't hack its systems but used automated software to scrape the data from Facebook's platform.The problem stemmed from a vulnerability, reported and fixed in 2019, in features that allow users to import contacts.\u201cThese features are common to many apps and we look forward to explaining them and the protections we have put in place,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.Still, it's another example of the vast amount of information collected by Facebook and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is. And even though Facebook has patched the vulnerability, the user data is already out in the open and could be exploited by fraudsters.Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, has its European headquarters in Ireland, making that country's watchdog its lead privacy regulator for the European Union under a system known as \u201cone-stop shop.\u201dIrish regulators are already working on a dozen other investigations of Facebook and Instagram over suspected privacy breaches.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/irish-watchdog-opens-facebook-probe-data-dump-77070848", "date": "April 14, 2021, 1:33 PM"}
