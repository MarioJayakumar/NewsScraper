The Dean of Windsor shall sayTHE BIDDINGWE are here today in St George\u2019s Chapel to commit into the hands of God the soul of his servant Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. With grateful hearts, we remember the many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us. We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the Nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith. Our lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us, the encouragement that he has given us, his kindness, humour and humanity. We therefore pray that God will give us grace to follow his example, and that, with our brother Philip, at the last, we shall know the joys of life eternal.All sit.

His command speeds the snow storm and sends the swift lightning to execute his sentence. To that end the storehouses are opened, and the clouds fly out like birds. By his mighty power the clouds are piled up and the hailstones broken small. The crash of his thunder makes the earth writhe, and, when he appears, an earthquake shakes the hills. At his will the south wind blows, the squall from the north and the . He scatters the snow-flakes like birds alighting; they settle like a swarm of locusts. The eye is dazzled by their beautiful whiteness, and as they fall the mind is entranced. He spreads frost on the earth like salt, and icicles form like pointed stakes. A cold blast from the north, and ice grows hard on the water, settling on every pool, as though the water were putting on a breastplate. He consumes the hills, scorches the wilderness, and withers the grass like fire. Cloudy weather quickly puts all to rights, and dew brings welcome relief after heat. By the power of his thought he tamed the deep and planted it with islands. Those who sail the sea tell stories of its dangers, which astonish all who hear them; in it are strange and wonderful creatures, all kinds of living things and huge sea-monsters. By his own action he achieves his end, and by his word all things are held together.All remain seated as the choir singsTHE JUBILATEO BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands:serve the Lord with gladness,and come before his presence with a song.Be ye sure that the Lord he is God:it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving,and into his courts with praise:be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting:and his truth endureth from generation to generation.Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:world without end.

And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.\u201d Jesus said to her, \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d Martha said to him, \u201cI know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\u201d Jesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d She said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world.\u201dAll remain seated as the choir singsPSALM 104The Duke of Edinburgh requested that Psalm 104 should be set to music by William Lovelady.Originally composed as a cantata in three movements, it was first sung in honour of His Royal Highness\u2019s 75th Birthday.MY SOUL give praise unto the Lord of heaven,In majesty and honour clothed;The earth he made will not be moved,The seas he made to be its robe. Give praise.The waters rise above the highest mountain,And flow down to the vales and leas;At springs, wild asses quench their thirst,And birds make nest amid the trees.The trees the Lord has made are full of vigour,The fir tree is a home for storks;Wild goats find refuge in the hills,From foes the conies shelter in the rocks.My soul give praise unto the Lord of heaven,In majesty and honour clothed;The earth he made will not be moved,The seas he made to be its robe. Give praise.7O Lord, how manifold is your creation,All things in wisdom you provide;You give your riches to the earth,And to the sea so great and wide.You take your creatures breath and life is ended,Your breath goes forth and life begins;Your hand renews the face of earth,Your praise my whole life I will sing.My soul give praise unto the Lord of heaven,In majesty and honour clothed;The earth he made will not be moved,The seas he made to be its robe.
