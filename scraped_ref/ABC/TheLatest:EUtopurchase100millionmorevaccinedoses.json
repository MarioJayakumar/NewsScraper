Most vaccines require two shots to provide full immunization.\u2014\u2014\u2014THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\u2014 CDC says half of U.S. adults         \u2014 AP PHOTOS: As global toll tops 3 million, 15 photographers each reflect on a         \u2014          as virus surges\u2014         , as virus forces a rethink\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow all of AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at          and         \u2014\u2014\u2014HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s minister for planning and development said Monday that authorities are struggling to maintain the much-need supply of oxygen to hospitals for COVID-19 patients.Asad Umar, who also oversees Pakistan\u2019s response to the coronavirus, said on Twitter that hospitals were continuously receiving coronavirus patients amid a surge in new cases.He said currently more than 4,500 COVID-19 patients need critical care at hospitals, but many people are still violating social distancing rules. Umar said citizens are \u201cmaking a huge mistake by not following\u201d social distancing rules.His warning comes hours after Pakistan reported 73 fatalities in a single day from the coronavirus and 5,152 new cases.Pakistan has reported 16,316 deaths among 761,437 cases since last year.So far, the government has resisted demands from doctors that it impose a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.\u2014\u2014\u2014LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says her state could be seeing a drop in infections after leading the nation\u2019s COVID-19 daily case rate for weeks.Whitmer has extended a pandemic order that limits business capacity and requires masks in public, but the Democrat has avoided further restrictions in place during previous surges, including suspending indoor restaurant dining.She told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that cases could be beginning to slow down. She didn\u2019t discuss specific data and Michigan doesn\u2019t release coronavirus-related data on Sundays. Health officials said Friday that the seven-day average positivity rate had dropped in recent days to 17.1%, but remained above a December peak of 14.4%.govWhitmer has urged a voluntary pause on activities like dining out and pushed for more vaccinations from the White House, which has said it would help with other logistics but continue allocating based on population.\u2014\u2014\u2014WASHINGTON \u2014 Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to meet this coming Friday to discuss the pause in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, and the top U.S. infectious disease expert says he\u2019d be \u201cvery surprised if we don\u2019t have a resumption in some form by Friday.\u201dDr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that \u201ca decision almost certainly will be made by Friday. I don\u2019t really anticipate that they\u2019re going to want it stretch it out a bit longer.\u201dFauci tells CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that one possibility would be to bring the one-and-done shots back \u201cwith some form of restrictions or some form of warning. \u2026I believe by Friday we\u2019re going to know the answer to that.\u2019The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is in limbo in the U.S. after federal health advisers said last week they needed more evidence to decide if a handful of unusual blood clots were linked to the shot \u2014 and if so, how big the risk is.The reports are rare \u2014 six cases out of more than 7 million inoculations with the J&J vaccine in the United States. The clots were found in six women between the ages of 18 and 48. One person died.Fauci told NBC\u2019s ``Meet the Press\u201d that \u201cI doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that will determine who is eligible to receive more than $530 million in federal virus relief funding set aside for tribes more than a year ago.More than a dozen Native American tribes sued the U.S. Treasury Department to keep the money out of the hands of Alaska Native corporations, which provide services to Alaska Natives but do not have a government-to-government relationship with the United States.The question raised in the case set for oral arguments Monday is whether the corporations are tribes for purposes of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which defines \u201ctribes\u201d under a 1975 law meant to strengthen their abilities to govern themselves.The case has practical impacts. Native Americans have been disproportionately sickened and killed by the pandemic \u2014 despite extreme precautions that included curfews, roadblocks, universal testing and business closures \u2014 and historically have had limited financial resources. About $530 million of the $8 billion set aside for tribes hasn\u2019t been distributed.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/latest-eu-purchase-100-million-vaccine-doses-77159753", "date": "April 19, 2021, 5:33 AM"}
