It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a matter of concern when you deploy a lot of troops,\" Borrell said. \u201cWell, a spark can jump here or there.\u201dInitially, Borrell told reporters that \u201cthere\u2019s more than 150,000 Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian borders and in Crimea,\" and doubled down on the figure later before his services had to correct it in the transcript, saying the real figure was over 100,000.Nevertheless, Borrell said that \"the risk of further escalation \u2014 it\u2019s evident.\u201dBorrell declined to say where he got the initial 150,000 Russian troop number from, but called it \u201cmy reference figure.\u201d It was higher than the 110,000 estimate provided by Ukrainian Defense Minister Andriy Taran on Wednesday.More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. The EU has steadfastly opposed the annexation but has been unable to do anything about it.Efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled and violations of a shaky truce have become increasingly frequent in recent weeks across Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.Diplomats had expected there was little to no chance of immediate new sanctions on Moscow, but they now will seek to apply more pressure nevertheless through diplomacy.\u201cMoscow must switch from provocation to cooperation,\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.And over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron said that while dialogue with Russia is essential, \u201cclear red lines\u201d carrying possible sanctions must also be drawn with Moscow over Ukraine.\u201cAll in all, the relations with Russia, are not improving, but the contrary, the tension is increasing in different fronts,\u201d Borrell said.\u201cWe call on Russia to withdraw their troops,\u201d Borrell said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-foreign-ministers-talk-amid-uproar-ukraine-navalny-77159653", "date": "April 19, 2021, 8:51 PM"}
