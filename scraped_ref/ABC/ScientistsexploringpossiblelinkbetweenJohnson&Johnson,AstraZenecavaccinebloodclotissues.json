In these subjects, the body's immune system has formed antibodies that attach to platelets, the specialized blood cells that join together to form clots.\"It's not the vaccine that's causing it -- it's the body's immune response to the vaccine,\" said Dr. Alex Spyropoulos, a blood clot specialist and professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research.Experts say the condition, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, is exceedingly rare.The Food and Drug Administration and CDC said that in the six women who experienced a clot, the problem manifested six to 13 days after receiving the shot, a time frame that tracks with an immune response, Spyropoulos said.It's still not clear why a vaccine would trigger this cascade of events, but researchers said it mimics another well-documented reaction to heparin, a common blood thinner. For this reason, the CDC and FDA have warned against using heparin to treat anyone recently vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Existing evidence from the United States and Europe hints that women may be at greater risk \u2013 perhaps in part because women are already more likely than men to develop CVST, based on previous data.\"We have to be careful about the assumptions we make,\" Spryopoulos cautioned, \"especially given how infrequent these events have been.\"It's possible similar cases will develop in men, but if the CDC advisory panel concludes that the risk is higher in women, the FDA could move toward a black box warning -- a label for drugs and medical devices with potentially serious side effects \u2013 on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for certain women.Though the abrupt halt to an already authorized vaccine may instill concerns and foment hesitancy around the vaccine, experts said it's a good sign drugs are being properly vetted for safety.\"I really want to stress to the public that they need to remain confident in our concepts and the times regarding vaccines in general,\" said Dr. Jason Goldman, an internal medicine doctor representing the American College of Physicians on the expert panel said, adding that members of the general public should \"not to let this sour your decision on getting vaccinated in general.\"\"We do have confidence in the process,\" Goldman added. \"And we will make the right decision regarding public safety.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/scientists-exploring-link-johnson-johnson-astrazeneca-blood-clot/story?id=77093834", "date": "April 17, 2021, 11:29 AM"}
