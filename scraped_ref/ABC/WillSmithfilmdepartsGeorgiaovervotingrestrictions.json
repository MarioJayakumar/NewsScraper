Opponents have said the law is designed to reduce the impact of minority voters.In a joint statement, Smith and Fuqua \u2014 who are both producers on the project \u2014 said they felt compelled to move the production out of Georgia.\u201cWe cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access,\u201d Smith and Fuqua said. \u201cThe new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting.\u201d\u201cEmancipation\u201d had been scheduled to begin shooting in June. Apple Studios acquired the film last year in a deal reportedly worth $130 million. Based on a true story, the film stars Smith as a slave who flees a Louisiana plantation and joins the Union Army.Hollywood's response to the Georgia law has been closely watched because the state is a major hub of film production and boasts generous tax incentives. Some filmmakers have said they would boycott, including \u201cFord v. Ferrari\u201d director James Mangold. But major studios         have so far been largely quiet. In 2019, a Georgia anti-abortion law (later declared unconstitutional) prompted studios to threaten to cease production in the state.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/smith-film-departs-georgia-voting-restrictions-77021309", "date": "April 12, 2021, 11:24 AM"}
