We warn the U.S. that it should stay away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast for their own benefit.\u201dNATO chief Stoltenberg expressed the Western military alliance\u2019s \u201cunwavering\u201d support for Ukraine during a news conference on Tuesday with Ukraine's foreign minister, calling the Russian movements \u201cunjustified, unexplained and deeply concerning.\u201dThe Kremlin has argued that Russia is free to deploy its troops wherever it wants on its territory and has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian military of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d along the line of control in the east and of planning to retake control of the rebel regions by force.Ryabkov reaffirmed Tuesday that \u201cif there is any escalation, we will do everything to ensure our own security and the security of our citizens whenever they are,\u201d adding that \u201cKyiv and its Western curators will bear all the responsibility for the consequences of that hypothetical escalation.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russia-troop-buildup-ukraine-response-nato-77045090", "date": "April 13, 2021, 12:04 PM"}
