Philip was a decorated naval officer whose military career spanned World War II.\u2014\u2014\u2014LONDON \u2014 People across Britain have observed one minute of silence in honor of the late Prince Philip just before his royal ceremonial funeral got underway inside St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.Philip, who was consort to Queen Elizabeth II for 73 years, died April 9, just two months shy of his 100th birthday.His coffin, draped in his personal standard and topped with a wreath of flowers and his naval cap and sword have, arrived at St. George\u2019s Chapel inside Windsor Castle. The queen and senior royals accompanied the coffin as it was carried on a specially adapted Land Rover.Only 30 close family members and friends will attend the service, amid nationwide restrictions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19. While the proceedings are being broadcast live around the world, members of the public won\u2019t be able to watch any part of the procession or service in person because of the pandemic.\u2014\u2014\u2014WINDSOR, England \u2014 Princes William and Harry didn\u2019t line up shoulder to shoulder Saturday as they took their places for the procession that will follow Prince Philip\u2019s coffin to the church for his funeral.William and Harry\u2019s cousin Peter Phillips stood between the princes as they prepared to escort the coffin to St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.The arrangement minimized the chances of any awkward moments between the brothers, who have faced strains in their relationship since Harry\u2019s decision to step away from royal duties last year.William, 38, is second in line to the throne. Harry, 36, and his wife, Meghan, last month gave an interview to U.S. television host Oprah Winfrey in which they said royal staffers were insensitive toward Meghan and that an unidentified member of the royal family made racist comments.\u2014\u2014\u2014WINDSOR, England \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II has left the Sovereign\u2019s Entrance of Windsor Castle as members of the royal family prepare for the procession that will precede the funeral of Prince Philip.The queen, accompanied by a lady-in waiting, wore a mask as she was driven in a Bentley that will carry her to St. George\u2019s Chapel for the funeral of her husband of 73 years.Elizabeth has always sought to set an example for the nation during her long reign, and face coverings are required in England under rules designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.

His family ties were just as broad, with Britain\u2019s longest-serving consort linked by blood and marriage to most of the continent\u2019s royal houses.\u201cIf Queen Victoria is considered the grandmother of Europe, Prince Philip is the uncle of Europe,\u201d said Vassilis Koutsavlis, president of the Tatoi Royal Estate Friends Association.It\u2019s in that densely wooded estate at the foot of a mountain north of Athens that Philip\u2019s father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, lies buried.
