Soeder has much better poll ratings, but Laschet is the recently elected leader of by far the bigger party.On         Monday, Laschet rallied the CDU leadership behind his bid and called for a quick decision. But Soeder resisted pressure to resolve the matter immediately and said it needs to be discussed with people beyond senior party officials, pointing to his superior poll ratings.Soeder hopes for support from CDU lawmakers who worry about their own chances of re-election.After attending a regular meeting Tuesday of the two parties' joint parliamentary group in Berlin, both men emerged to say that the talks were productive and that they hoped to have a decision by week's end.\u201cWe are both convinced that we will be able to come to a good result,\u201d Soeder told reporters.Merkel, asked Tuesday whether she was worried the pair's rivalry could damage the Union bloc and lead to it losing the chancellery, made clear she had no intention of intervening.\u201cI wanted, want to and will stay out of it,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/merkel-stays-battle-runs-german-leader-77040814", "date": "April 13, 2021, 1:28 PM"}
