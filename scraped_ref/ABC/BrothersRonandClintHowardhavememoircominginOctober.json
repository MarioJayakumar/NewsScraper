According to William Morrow, a HarperCollins Publishers imprint, the book will help answer a perennial question asked of Ron Howard: What was it like to grow up on television?\u201cIn \u2018The Boys,\u2019 he and his younger brother, Clint, examine their childhoods in detail for the first time,\u201d the publisher's statement Monday reads in part. \u201cFor Ron, playing Opie on \u2018The Andy Griffith Show\u2019 and Richie Cunningham on \u2018Happy Days\u2019 offered fame, joy, and opportunity \u2014 but also invited stress and bullying. For Clint, a fast start on such programs as \u2018Gentle Ben\u2019 and \u2018Star Trek\u2019 petered out in adolescence, with some tough consequences and lessons.\u201dAccording to the Howards, \u201cThe Boys\u201d was first inspired by the death of their father, actor Rance Howard.\u201cWhen our dad passed in 2017, Clint and I began reflecting upon our lives and realized that while our childhoods seemed normal, they were anything but,\" Ron Howard, who as an adult has directed such acclaimed films as \u201cApollo 13\u201d and \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d said in a statement.\"Who grows up on a soundstage hanging out with Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, or with a trained bear? And what are the ways that particular childhood forever informed the choices I would make as a husband, father and filmmaker? We\u2019re excited to share the story of how our parents pulled this off \u2014 raising two show-business kids who had no clue that their lives were out of the ordinary while rooting them in a loving, slightly off-beat family.\u201dClint Howard, whose hundreds of other acting credits range from \u201cSeinfeld\" to several films by his brother, said in a statement: \u201cMom and dad\u2018s teachings are treasures to this day but I\u2019ve realized that I took their presence for granted. Writing \u2018The Boys\u2019 with my brother has been the topper of a wonderful lifetime.\u201dRon Howard's daughter, actor-filmmaker Bryce Dallas Howard, wrote a foreword for the book.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/brothers-ron-clint-howard-memoir-coming-october-77019125", "date": "April 12, 2021, 8:46 AM"}
