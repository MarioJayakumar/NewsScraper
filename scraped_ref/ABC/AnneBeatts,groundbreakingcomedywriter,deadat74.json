She was 74.Beatts died Wednesday at her home in West Hollywood, California, according to her close friend Rona Edwards. Edwards, a film producer and a fellow faculty member at Chapman University, did not immediately know the cause of death.Starting in 1975 and running for five seasons, Beatts was among a team of gifted writers that included Rosie Shuster, Alan Zweibel, Marilyn Suzanne Miller and such cast members as Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase who helped make \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d a cultural phenomenon. With Shuster, she would invent the beloved young nerds \u2014 the nasally, Marvin Hamlisch-adoring Lisa Loopner (played by Gilda Radner) and high-pantsed goofball Todd DiLaMuca (Bill Murray), and help coin such catchphrases as Lisa's, \u201cThat's so funny I forgot to laugh.\u201dBeatts would later draw upon her own acknowledged background as an outsider in high school for her own series \u201cSquare Pegs.\u201d\u201cIf you look looked at the nerds, she knew that world,\" Zweibel told The Associated Press. \u201cShe and Rosie handled those characters with love. She knew that world. If you look at \u2018Square Pegs,\u2019 the title alone speaks volumes.\u201dPremiering in 1982, \u201cSquare Pegs\u201d was then a rare sitcom centering on teen-age girls and starring Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role as a first-year high school student trying to fit in. \u201cSquare Pegs\u201d lasted just one season but was loved by critics and later praised for anticipating \u2014 and topping \u2014 the teen comedies John Hughes would soon become famous for.\u201cThe show was also just plain cool, speaking to teens with a shared interest in their interests that made young people feel seen before the Hughes movies would have a similar effect,\u201d New York magazine's Jen Chaney wrote in 2020. \u201cNo other show on TV back then would have focused an entire episode on a Pac-Man addiction or a New Wave-themed bat mitzvah that featured the actual band Devo performing \u2018That\u2019s Good.\u2019\u201dOn Thursday, Parker tweeted: \u201cStruggling to find adequate and appropriate descriptive words to describe her singular self. I need time. Cause I\u2019m coming up short. Gosh, she was really something. RIP Anne. Thank you. For memories very few 17/18 yr olds get to make.\"Beatts\u2019 later credits included writing for \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d and \u201cThe Belles of Bleeker Street,\u201d producing \u201cA Different World\u201d and helping to write the stage musical \u201cLeader of the Pack.\u201d She is survived by her daughter, Jaylene; sister Barbara Resucha; and nieces Jennifer and Kate Dreger.Beatts was a native of Buffalo, New York, who eventually settled with her family further downstate in Somers. She grew up among readers and joke letters and spoke of honing her own wit if only to keep up.After attending McGill University, she got an early break writing comedy for National Lampoon magazine, where numerous future \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d performers and writers worked. She quit the magazine in the mid-1970s, out of frustration of being overlooked by the mostly male staff. But while there she began dating fellow writer Michael O'Donoghue, who was hired by producer Lorne Michaels for what became \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\u201cI was never a real reader of Lampoon,\u201d Michaels told Rolling Stone in 1983, \u201cbut Anne had been recommended to me by Michael O\u2019Donoghue. She thought I was hiring her for the wrong reasons \u2014 because O\u2019Donoghue was then her boyfriend \u2014 and when we met, she was a combination of friendly and wary. She was a little combative. But that was 1975. Everyone was a little combative in 1975.\u201dBeatts, who initially turned Michaels down in part because she didn't like television, already was known for an unusual sense of humor that was shared by many on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In a mock Volkswagen ad that ran in Lampoon, she provided a notorious slogan, referring to Sen. Ted Kennedy's 1969 car accident on Chappaquiddick Island: \u201cIf Ted Kennedy drove a Volkswagen, he\u2019d be President today.\u201dIn an email to The Associated Press, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Laraine Newman wrote that Beatts \u201cbrought the toughness of National Lampoon along with her when she wrote on our show. But she didn't learn it at Lampoon. She already had it. Such a contradiction too because she was a very sweet person.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014This story has been updated to to correct the name of the friend who confirmed Beatts' death. She is Rona Edwards, not Rona Kennedy.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/correction-obit-anne-beatts-story-76996285", "date": "April 10, 2021, 4:12 PM"}
