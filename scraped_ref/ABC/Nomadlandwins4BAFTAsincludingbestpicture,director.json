The ceremony opened with a tribute to Philip, who was the academy's first president in 1959.Presenters including Hugh Grant, Tom Hiddleston, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Priyanka Chopra Jonas announced the winners from the stage of London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, but recipients accepted their honors remotely, and there was no black-tie audience to cheer them on.Director Remi Weekes, who won the British debut prize for his first feature, \u201cHis House,\u201d noted the surreal sensation of accepting the award while sitting in his living room in a tuxedo.\u201cNomadland\u201d stars McDormand as a middle-aged woman who travels the American West while living out of her van and picking up short-term work.Zhao, who lived among real American travelers for the film, thanked \u201cthe nomadic community who so generously welcomed us into their lives.\u201d\u201cHow we treat our elders says a lot about who we are as a society, and we need to do better,\u201d she said.The only previous female directing winner was Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201dThe British film academy expanded its voting membership and shook up its rules last year in an attempt to address a glaring lack of diversity in the nominations. In 2020, no women were nominated as best director for a seventh consecutive year, and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Under new rules that, among other things, made watching all longlisted films compulsory for academy voters, this year\u2019s slate of acting nominees was strikingly more diverse, and four of the six filmmakers nominated for best director were women: Zhao, Sarah Gavron (\u201cRocks\u201d), Shannon Murphy (\u201cBabyteeth\u201d) and Jasmila Zbanic (\u201cQuo Vadis, Aida?\u201d).Asked what her directing prize meant for Asian women in film, Zhao said: \u201cIf this means more people like me get to live their dreams, then I feel very grateful.\u201dBAFTA chief executive Amanda Berry said the academy was \u201cdetermined to make change.\u201d\u201cWe are not there yet, this is definitely still a work in progress, but I am really pleased with how far we have come,\u201d she said.Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in \u201cJudas and the Black Messiah.\u201dYoun appeared astonished to win the best-actress prize for Korean-American family drama \u201cMinari.\u201d The Korean performer said she had always thought of the British as \u201cvery snobbish people.\u201d But, she later clarified, \u201cnot in a bad way.\u201dBakray, 19, won the Rising Star award, whose previous winners include Kaluuya, Kristin Stewart, Tom Hardy and John Boyega.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we filmed \u2018Rocks,\u2019 I thought 100 people would watch this film, max.\u201dDanish director Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s \u201cAnother Round\u201d was named best film not in the English language. Vinterberg paid tribute to his daughter Ida, who had been due to appear in the film and died in a car crash at the start of the shoot.\u201cWe made this movie for her, so the honor granted by you, BAFTA voters, means more to us than you could ever imagine,\u201d he said.The British awards are usually held a week or two before the Academy Awards and have become an important awards-season staging post. This year, both the BAFTAs and the Oscars were postponed from their usual February berths because of the coronavirus pandemic.BAFTAs in craft and backstage categories were handed out in a separate ceremony on Saturday, when \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d won two prizes, for costume design and hair and makeup.Other double winners included \u201cThe Father\u201d (best actor and adapted screenplay), \u201cSound of Metal\u201d (editing and sound), \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d (British film and original screenplay) and \u201cSoul\u201d (animated film and musical score).Director Ang Lee was awarded the academy\u2019s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship.Actor, writer and director Noel Clarke received the outstanding British contribution to cinema award, dedicating it to \u201cmy young Black boys and girls out there that never believed it could happen to them.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/rocks-nomadland-lead-race-covid-curbed-bafta-awards-77003288", "date": "April 11, 2021, 8:30 PM"}
