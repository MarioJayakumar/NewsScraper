When Donald Trump came onto the scene in 2015, some analysts assumed his anti-immigrant rhetoric would be poison for Latino voters. But in 2016, Trump did no worse than Mitt Romney with that group, and possibly better -- depending on which data you look at. And in 2020, Trump improved on his 2016 margin with Latino voters by five percentage points, according to the exit polls. In 2020, Joe Biden won Latinos easily on the whole: 65% to 32%. But as people who watch elections know, trends and margins matter, and Latino voters aren\u2019t a monolith who all vote the same way.
