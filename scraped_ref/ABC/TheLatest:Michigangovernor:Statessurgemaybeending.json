Gretchen Whitmer says her state could be seeing a drop in infections after leading the nation\u2019s COVID-19 daily case rate for weeks.Whitmer has extended a pandemic order that limits business capacity and requires masks in public, but the Democrat has avoided further restrictions in place during previous surges, including suspending indoor restaurant dining.She told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that cases could be beginning to slow down. She didn\u2019t discuss specific data and Michigan doesn\u2019t release coronavirus-related data on Sundays. Health officials said Friday that the seven-day average positivity rate had dropped in recent days to 17.1%, but remained above a December peak of 14.4%.govWhitmer has urged a voluntary pause on activities like dining out and pushed for more vaccinations from the White House, which has said it would help with other logistics but continue allocating based on population.\u2014\u2014\u2014THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\u2014 CDC says half of U.S. adults         \u2014 AP PHOTOS: As global toll tops 3 million, 15 photographers each reflect on a         \u2014          as virus surges\u2014         , as virus forces a rethink\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow all of AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at          and         \u2014\u2014\u2014HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:WASHINGTON \u2014 Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to meet this coming Friday to discuss the pause in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, and the top U.S. infectious disease expert says he\u2019d be \u201cvery surprised if we don\u2019t have a resumption in some form by Friday.\u201dDr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that \u201ca decision almost certainly will be made by Friday.

The clots were found in six women between the ages of 18 and 48. One person died.Fauci told NBC\u2019s ``Meet the Press\u201d that \u201cI doubt very seriously if they just cancel it.

There were 55,802 new daily infections, pushing the overall figure to nearly 4.27 million, the ministry added.Weekly data also released Sunday showed the northwest province of Canakkale had the highest rate of cases in the country, with 962.98 infections per 100,000 people.Turkey has seen rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths since restrictions were eased at the start of March, when daily cases were below 10,000. The government has blamed the rising numbers on coronavirus mutations.A partial closure was re-introduced on April 13, with tighter controls such as an extended evening weekday curfew, a return to online education and a ban on unnecessary intercity travel.Earlier, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had also re-imposed weekend lockdowns and ordered restaurants and cafes shut during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.A vaccination program was launched in mid-January and Erdogan said Saturday that 20 million doses had been administered in the country of nearly 84 million.\u2014\u2014VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis says he is happy to be back greeting the faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square for his traditional Sunday noon blessing after weeks of lockdown measures.Italy later this month will start gradually lifting some anti-pandemic restrictions, allowing, for example, outdoor dining at cafes and restaurants in areas of the country where the COVID-19 outbreak has been showing signs of improvement.A couple of hundred people, including nuns and families, standing a safe distance apart in the vast square, turned out to see the pope speak from a window of the Apostolic Palace. \u201cThank God, we can gather in this square again,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI have to say, I miss the square.\u201dThe past weeks have seen Francis standing at a lectern inside the palace to deliver his Sunday noon remarks via TV, radio and internet.\u201cThank God and thank you for your presence,\u201d Francis told those who showed up despite clouds threatening a downpour in Rome.\u2014\u2014\u2014JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel has lifted a public mask mandate and fully reopened its education system in the latest easing of coronavirus restrictions following its mass vaccination drive.All primary and secondary school grades returned to classrooms on Sunday, and health officials ended a year-long requirement to wear a mask in public spaces. Masks are still required indoors and in large gatherings.Israel has speedily inoculated a majority of its population against the coronavirus in a world-leading vaccination campaign. It has lifted most of its coronavirus restrictions and announced last week that it would be reopening the country to vaccinated foreign tourists starting in May.Israel\u2019s coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, told Israeli public radio on Sunday that removing the mask requirement outdoors and reinitiating in-class studies was a \u201ccalculated risk.\u201dSince the start of the pandemic last year, Israel has recorded over 836,000 cases of the coronavirus and at least 6,331 deaths, according to the Health Ministry. Over 53% of its 9.3 million citizens has received two shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.In the months since Israel launched its vaccination campaign in December, serious cases and deaths have fallen precipitously and allowed the economy to fully reopen.The vaccination campaign in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza has been slow to get off the ground, with Israel facing criticism for not sharing more of its supplies.\u2014\u2014\u2014ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan has reported its highest single-day death toll from COVID-19, bringing the country\u2019s total deaths in the pandemic to nearly 162,430.Federal authorities on Sunday said 149 new deaths were recorded in 24 hours confirmed.

But those groups have not responded in overwhelming numbers to the vaccination campaign, prompting officials to offer the vaccines to a younger cohort.Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, hopes to receive 15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses through the U.N.-backed COVAX program by next month.\u2014\u2014\u2014HUTCHINSON, Minn. \u2014 Prosecutors have charged a Minnesota man with felony assault and allege that he attacked a home improvement store employee and a police officer after the store worker told him to wear a mask.The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the incident began Wednesday afternoon when a cashier at a Menards in Hutchinson told 61-year-old Luke Oeltjenbruns that he couldn\u2019t check out unless he put on a mask, according to a criminal complaint. Oeltjenbruns tried to leave with his merchandise, prompting the cashier to grab his cart.The complaint alleges that Oeltjenbruns hit the cashier with a piece of lumber. Police later found Oeltjenbruns sitting in his pickup truck in another store\u2019s parking lot.After a slow-speed chase, officers surrounded his truck with their squad cars, but he refused to get out. Officer Steven Sickmann got up on the truck\u2019s running board and reached through the window.

Tickets can be written.But at least a dozen forces throughout Ontario, including in the capital of Toronto, said there will be no random stops of people or cars.\u201cWe are all going through a horrific year of COVID-19 and all associated with it together. The (department) will NOT be randomly stopping vehicles for no reason during the pandemic or afterwards,\u201d Halton Police Chief Steve Tanner tweeted.The new rules limit outdoor gatherings to those in the same household and close playgrounds and golf courses. The decisions sparked widespread criticism in a province already on lockdown. Restaurants and gyms are closed as is in-class schooling. Most nonessential workers are working from home.\u2014\u2014\u2014ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that will determine who is eligible to receive more than $530 million in federal virus relief funding set aside for tribes more than a year ago.More than a dozen Native American tribes sued the U.S. Treasury Department to keep the money out of the hands of Alaska Native corporations, which provide services to Alaska Natives but do not have a government-to-government relationship with the United States.The question raised in the case set for oral arguments Monday is whether the corporations are tribes for purposes of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which defines \u201ctribes\u201d under a 1975 law meant to strengthen their abilities to govern themselves.The case has practical impacts. Native Americans have been disproportionately sickened and killed by the pandemic \u2014 despite extreme precautions that included curfews, roadblocks, universal testing and business closures \u2014 and historically have had limited financial resources. About $530 million of the $8 billion set aside for tribes hasn\u2019t been distributed.\u2014\u2014\u2014HARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Zimbabwe has begun releasing about 3,000 prisoners under a presidential amnesty aimed at easing congestion to reduce the threat of COVID-19 in the country\u2019s overcrowded jails.About 400 prisoners were released from Chikurubi prison and other jails in the capital, Harare, on Saturday with more coming from other prisons countrywide.Zimbabwe\u2019s prisons have a capacity of 17,000 prisoners but held about 22,000 before the amnesty declared by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.Those to be released had been convicted of nonviolent crimes.The amnesty \u201cwill go a long way\u201d to reduce expenditure and the threat of the spread of the virus in prisons, said Alvord Gapare, the commander for prisons in Harare. He said prisons in the capital had recorded 173 confirmed infections and one death.Zimbabwe has recorded 37,534 cases of COVID-19, including 1,551 deaths by Apr. 17, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u2014\u2014\u2014RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The first cases of the so-called Brazil COVID-19 variant have been identified in two samples from residents of Virginia, state health officials said Friday.In a news release, the Virginia Department of Health said one case involving the P.1 variant was identified in an adult resident of the Northwest Region who had a history of domestic travel during the exposure period. The second case was identified in an adult resident of the Eastern Region with no history of travel, the department said.According to the department, neither case had a record of COVID-19 vaccination prior to the onset of the illness.\u2014\u2014SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 State health officials say more than 8 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Illinois.The state\u2019s Department of Public Health said Sunday that the seven-day average of daily shots is just over 125,000.
