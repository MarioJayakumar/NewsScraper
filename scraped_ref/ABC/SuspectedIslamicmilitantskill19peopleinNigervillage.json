The following month 237 more were killed in a series of attacks at the hands of armed gunmen aboard motorcycles.There have been no claims of responsibility for the wave of attacks.Not only are jihadis active in the Tillaberi region, but the counterterrorism offensives against those extremists have helped give rise to ethnic militias, analysts say. Intercommunal tensions have been exacerbated as a result, particularly near the border between Mali and Niger.The mounting violence poses a strong threat to Niger's newly inaugurated President Mohamed Bazoum. He was sworn into office earlier this month only days after security forces thwarted an attempted military coup at the presidential palace in the capital of Niamey.\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writer Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/suspected-islamic-militants-kill-19-people-niger-village-77154251", "date": "April 18, 2021, 5:41 PM"}
