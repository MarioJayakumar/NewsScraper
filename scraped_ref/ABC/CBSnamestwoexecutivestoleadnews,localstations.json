They had been placed on leave in January         following a Los Angeles Times investigation found they had fostered a hostile work environment for women and minorities.The two new executives will also oversee the CBSN streaming service and the network's online news operation.Khemlani is a former reporter at newspapers and television, producing for Peter Jennings at ABC News and later on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d at CBS. Most recently, he's been executive vice president and deputy group head at Hearst Newspapers.McMahon has overseen the eight ABC-owned television stations since 2017. She also has CBS roots, having worked at local stations in Boston and Minneapolis.In a memo to staff members on Thursday, Cheeks said that Khemlani and McMahon will run the division as a team with each having specific areas of focus. Khemlani has been based in New York, where the CBS News headquarters is located, and McMahon has been in Los Angeles.Cheeks said he's been discussing a \u201csignificant role\u201d for Zirinsky at a new CBS News Content Studio that will be launched later in the year.In her two years, Zirinsky has set new leadership at \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The morning and evening news shows have trailed rivals in the ratings as the division, like all news operations, faces the challenge of attracting young consumers.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/cbs-names-executives-lead-news-local-stations-77103939", "date": "April 15, 2021, 5:39 PM"}
