The term \u201cforeign agent\u201d carries strong pejorative connotations in Russia.Since October, Roskomnadzor has filed 390 violation cases against RFE/RL and is expected to announce more Friday. The broadcaster says the fines could total the equivalent of $2.4 million.RFE/RL said it is asking the human rights court to order Russia to refrain from enforcing the fines until the court can make a full ruling on Roskomnadzor's moves, which the broadcaster contends violates the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201cWe are hopeful that the European Court of Human Rights will view these actions by the government of Russia for what they are: an attempt to suppress free speech and the human rights of the Russian people,\u201d RFE/RL president Jamie Fly said in a statement Thursday.Russia recently has stepped up actions that appear to be aimed at stifling dissent. Criminal charges were filed this week against four editors of an online student magazine that had posted a video connected to the nationwide protests in January calling for the release of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny.A court last week fined  8.9 million rubles, about $117,000, for failing to take down posts in which users called for minors to take part in unauthorized protests.The statement that Roskomnadzor has ordered RFE/RL to place on its material reads: \u201cThis report (material) was created and (or) disseminated by a foreign mass medium performing the functions of a foreign agent and (or) a Russian legal entity performing the functions of a foreign agent.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/us-broadcaster-asks-european-court-block-russian-fines-77110900", "date": "April 16, 2021, 3:32 AM"}
