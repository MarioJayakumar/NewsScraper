Boulders were hurled by the pressurized nitrogen gas that was fired at the ground to churn up material for vacuuming, and by the spacecraft's getaway thruster. One 1-ton boulder was flung an estimated 40 feet (12 meters).The Osiris-Rex team meticulously plotted the final flyover to ensure the best shots. The pictures were taken around noontime to avoid shadows and better see the changes on Bennu's rocky surface.\u201cThese observations were not in the original mission plan, so we were excited to go back and document what we did,\u201d the University of Arizona's Dathon Golish said in a statement.Osiris-Rex will depart Bennu\u2019s vicinity next month and head back toward Earth with its precious 2-pound (1-kilogram) sample load. It\u2019s due to arrive in 2023.The solar-orbiting, carbon-rich asteroid is 182 million miles (293 million kilometers) from Earth. By studying pieces of it, scientists hope to better understand how our solar system's planets formed and how people should react if an asteroid endangers Earth.\u2014\u2014\u2014The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
