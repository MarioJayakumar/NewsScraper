The elections were initially slated to be held last September.Lam was speaking a day ahead of the first reading of draft amendments to various laws in the city\u2019s legislature, to accommodate Beijing\u2019s planned changes to the city\u2019s electoral system.Beijing in March announced changes to Hong Kong\u2019s electoral system, expanding the number of seats in the legislature while reducing the number of directly-elected seats from 35 to 20.The move is part of a two-phase effort to rein in political protest and opposition in Hong Kong, which is part of China but has had a more liberal political system as a former British colony. China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong last year and is following up this year with a revamp of the electoral process.The crackdown comes in the wake of months of pro-democracy protests in 2019 that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets and turned violent as the government resisted the movement\u2019s demands.In the current 70-member legislature, voters elect half the members and the other half are chosen by constituencies representing various professions and interest groups. Many of the constituencies lean pro-Beijing, ensuring that wing a majority in the legislature.The new body will have 20 elected members, 30 chosen by the constituencies and 40 by an Election Committee which also chooses the city\u2019s leader.The committee, which will be expanded from 1,200 to 1,500 members, is dominated by supporters of the central government in Beijing.A new, separate body will also be set up to review the qualifications of candidates for office in Hong Kong to ensure that the city is governed by \u201cpatriots,\u201d in the language of the central government.Elections for the Election Committee, which will choose the city\u2019s leader and 40 lawmakers, will be held on Sept. 19. Elections for the chief executive will take place on March 27, 2022, Lam said Tuesday.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hong-kongs-legislative-elections-place-december-77039474", "date": "April 13, 2021, 8:34 PM"}
