They may just be the perfect antidote to binge watching.Elizabeth McCracken\u2019s latest collection, \u201cThe Souvenir Museum,\u201d is a good place to start. There are a dozen stories here, the longest just 26 pages. About half are previously published and four feature a couple named Sadie and Jack. Their tales don\u2019t appear back-to-back-to-back-to-back or even chronologically, so it\u2019s a refreshing surprise to get a glimpse of their lives every few stories. We\u2019re treated to a family wedding in Ireland, their honeymoon in Holland, a revealing episode with Sadie\u2019s mom in Massachusetts, and their \u201cmeet cute\u201d story involving puppets in Boston.Short stories in general require a little more concentration compared to the slow build and wider frame of a novel. Thankfully, McCracken is adept at packing a lot of meaning into a few lines. \u201cShe knew her maternal love would always be edged with meanness, so as to matter: sometimes you needed a blade to get results,\u201d writes McCracken in \u201cA Walk-Through Human Heart\u201d as a mother contemplates buying her pregnant daughter a mechanical doll that chews and excretes real . Or back to that origin story starring Sadie and Jack (\u201cTwo Sad Clowns\u201d): \u201cThat was the thing about being in love: you were allowed to hate things,\u201d writes McCracken as the couple banters soon after meeting.The eponymous story in the collection is a real gem, introducing readers to Joanna and her pre-teen son, Leo, on vacation in Denmark. Joanna tells her son the purpose of the trip is to visit \u201cLegoland,\u201d but it turns out Leo\u2019s absentee father lives there as well. It\u2019s against that backdrop McCracken gives us beautiful insights like these, as Joanna listens to Leo disabuse her of the notion that Viking helmets had horns: \u201cFor a year and a half, before Leo could read but after he\u2019d begun to talk, Joanna had known everything in his head, thoughts and terrors, facts and passions. \u2026 Now, he had thoughts all the time that she hadn\u2019t put in his head, which she knew was the point of having children but destroyed her.\u201dI could go on quoting from each story, but do yourself a favor and read the book. McCracken has delivered a lovely collection of stories loosely tied together by one theme \u2014 the bonds of family that fracture and heal as lives are led.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-read-master-class-short-story-telling-77022533", "date": "April 12, 2021, 11:31 AM"}
