Stan stars opposite Denise Gough as a pair of strangers who start an intense summer affair in Greece in director Argyris Papadimitropoulos\u2019 film.\u2014 If the Athens club scene is a little too intense for your quarantine addled brain, perhaps Sofia Coppola\u2019s 2010 masterpiece         \u201cSomewhere\u201d is more your speed. Coming to Amazon Prime Video on Friday, the mesmerizing and meditative film stars Stephen Dorff as a jaded movie star living in the tabloid-ridden Chateau Marmont who finds himself caring for his young daughter Cleo (a breakout performance from Elle Fanning). Like all Coppola films, the sensational and glamorous setting is just a backdrop for her acutely observed and humane portrait of a father and daughter at a tender time in her life. If you haven\u2019t seen it, now is as good a time as any to check out what AP listed as one of the best films of the last decade.\u2014 A modern and youthful spin on the Arthurian legend, writer-director Joe Cornish\u2019s         \u201cThe Kid Who Would Be King\u201d didn\u2019t get nearly enough attention or praise when it came out two years ago. But the family can get a chance to check it when it hits Disney+ on Friday. Andy Serkis\u2019s son, the charming Louis Ashbourne Serkis, leads a charismatic British cast of fresh faces and veterans (including Patrick Stewart as \u201cold\u201d Merlin). I wrote in my review that the time that,         \u201cIt\u2019s an Amblin-esque movie about fantasy, geek culture and outcasts that\u2019s actually been made for modern kids.\u201d Gough also co-stars in this as Serkis\u2019s mom.\u2014 Finally, college students this week will get a chance to screen the five-time Oscar nominee \u201cPromising Young Woman.\u201d Focus Features and the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN are partnering with Campus Circle to host free virtual screenings of Emerald Fennell\u2019s provocative film starring Carey Mulligan on Thursday night. AP\u2019s Jocelyn Noveck         in her review said that the \u201cbracingly original\u201d film \u201cdefies labels.\u201d\u2014 AP Film Writer Lindsey BahrMUSIC\u2014 Rockers         Greta Van Fleet are back with their sophomore full-length album, \u201cThe Battle at Garden\u2019s Gate.\u201d They rode a Led Zeppelin sound to a Grammy win for best rock album and haven't deviated too much from that approach with the new collection. But there are signs of an evolution, with a more unrushed, atmospheric and expansive approach this time. Haters will always hate but isn't imitation the sincerest form of flattery?\u2014 The most famous singer in the cast of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d was Tony-winner Neil Patrick Harris but he's not the only one with a set of pipes.         Josh Radnor is releasing an EP this week, \u201cOne More Then I\u2019ll Let You Go.\u201d Radnor \u2014 part of the indie-folk duo Radnor & Lee \u2014 recorded the set over a year and a half beginning in the fall of 2018 and it includes the first of five songs to be released by him as a solo artist.\u2014 AP Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyTELEVISION\u2014 The docuseries         \u201cShine True\u201d devotes each episode to a transgender or non-conforming individual who\u2019s on a path of personal exploration, supported by mentors and family. Among them: Azul, who finds the \u201cpunk mariachi\u201d within before the opening of their art show, and Juan, who connects with his feminine side with help from the Latinx community. The half-hour series, airing 10 p.m. EDT Monday on the Fuse channel, is hosted by artist-activist Lucas Silveira and photographer Richie Shazam.\u2014         \u201cBig Shot\u201d stars John Stamos as a hot-button NCAA basketball coach who\u2019s bounced from the league and ends up coaching girls at an elite private high school. Will the tough guy acquire the sensitivity to connect with his teen players? Will students learn important lessons about the game and themselves? Odds are good on all counts with the Disney+ series, which co-stars Yvette Nicole Brown, Jessalyn Gilsig and Richard Robichaux. It debuts Friday.\u2014 Kate Winslet stars in HBO\u2019s limited series         \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d as a police detective investigating a murder possibly linked to a friend\u2019s missing daughter.

Guy Pearce, who played opposite Winslet in HBO\u2019s 2011 miniseries \u201cMildred Pierce\u201d (both won Emmys) does so again in the Pennsylvania-set series.\u2014 AP Television Writer Lynn Elber\u2014\u2014\u2014Catch up on AP\u2019s entertainment coverage here:         https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/week-big-shot-mare-easttown-monday-77026715", "date": "April 12, 2021, 2:29 PM"}
