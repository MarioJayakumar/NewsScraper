Our top suggestions begin with the best-picture nominees \u201cNomadland (         on Hulu and available for digital rental) the         West-wandering tale of itinerant travelers; \u201cSound of Metal\" (         on Amazon Prime ), a         piercing drama of deafness and addiction; \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d (available for digital rental),         the provocative revenge drama; and \u201cMinari\" (available for digital rental),         the achingly tender Korean-American family drama. Also recommended:         the lushly animated Irish animated film \u201cWolfwalkers\u201d (         on Apple TV+ ); the         songs of \u201cEurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\u201d (on         Netflix ); the         probing investigative Romanian documentary \u201cCollective\u201d (         on Hulu, and for rental elsewhere); the          joyous disability rights documentary \u201cCrip Camp\u201d (         on Netflix ); and the artfully composed \u201cTime\" (         on Amazon Prime ), a documentary about incarceration but also         the best love story of the year.\u2014 Anna Kendrick, Toni Collette and space is a solid recipe for any film. In         \u201cStowaway,\u201d debuting Friday on Netflix, they play researchers on a two-year mission to Mars who, shortly after liftoff, discover a stowaway (Shamier Anderson) on the ship.
