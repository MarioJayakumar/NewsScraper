The report was pulled down from the WHO website a day after it was published and was never reposted, sparking speculation WHO spiked it to spare the Italian government embarrassment and possible liability.The WHO says it contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies and was published prematurely, before it had been fact-checked. Its lead researcher, Dr. Francesco Zambon, says the report received all necessary clearances and believes it was removed because of political pressure and the personal interests of Guerra.Guerra had been in charge of prevention at the Italian health ministry during the years in which the pandemic plan should have been updated to conform to WHO and EU guidelines. Guerra has said the plan didn\u2019t need to be updated during those years and has denied he tried to censor the WHO report, saying he merely wanted it corrected.According to the text messages, Guerra used colorful language to inform Brusaferro that he had gotten the report removed from the WHO website and was working to make sure it had disappeared from other websites too.\u201cI was brutal with the fools of the Venice document,\u201d Guerra wrote, referring to Zambon\u2019s Venice-based team. \u201cI hope to also make a few incorrigible heads roll.\u201dBrusaferro noted at a press conference Friday that he merely acknowledged receipt of messages from Guerra and made no judgment about what he had texted.Brusaferro added that no one at the Superior Institute of Health had seen the WHO report before it was published and wasn\u2019t so much concerned about its content as surprised by its publication. He said the institute had no mandate or capacity to interfere with a U.N. report and denied having tried to cover it up.\u201cThe form in which my colleague (Guerra) expressed himself is a form that is his alone,\u201d Brusaferro said, referring to Guerra\u2019s messages. \u201cFor my part, I think I have never \u2014 and not just in this occasion, but I believe it\u2019s not part of my character or way of communicating \u2014 used tones that are anything but courteous, cordial and nice.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/italy-health-chief-distances-spiked-report-77125202", "date": "April 16, 2021, 4:20 PM"}
