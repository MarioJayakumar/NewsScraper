The ministry didn\u2019t release any specific comments made by Kerry during the meeting.Chung and Kerry agreed that the countries should cooperate to create \u201cmutual synergy\u201d between the virtual summits hosed by each country in the coming weeks, which would help set up the U.N. Climate Change Conference scheduled to be held in Scotland in November, the ministry said in a statement.Arriving for a dinner meeting at Chung\u2019s official residence in Seoul, a mask-wearing Kerry bumped forearms with Chung and wrote in a guestbook saying: \u201cThank you so much for Korea\u2019s leadership on the climate crisis.\u201dKerry and Chung had spoken over the phone twice last month to discuss the countries\u2019 cooperation on climate change and to exchange views on the U.N. Climate Change Conference, according to Chung\u2019s ministry.Kerry\u2019s visit to South Korea comes at a time when the Biden administration is also stepping up efforts to coordinate action with South Korea and Japan to cope with China\u2019s growing influence and North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.Three-way cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo had declined during the Trump administration, as the Asian U.S. allies feuded over wartime history, trade and military issues that sank their relations to post-war lows.South Korean President Moon Jae-in said last month he was eager to repair relations with Tokyo to build \u201cfuture-oriented ties,\u201d but there are now fresh tensions over Japan's approving the release of radioactive water from Fukushima.While Japan says the water will be treated and diluted so that it wouldn't pose a  threat to humans, South Korea has described the plan as \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and urged Tokyo to provide transparent information on how the plant\u2019s water is being treated and how its safety is being verified.The U.S. State Department had said Kerry\u2019s visits to China and South Korea were to discuss \u201craising global climate ambition\u201d ahead of Biden\u2019s climate meeting.Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Chinese head of state Xi Jinping, to participate in an April 22-23 virtual climate summit. The United States and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting carbon emissions and pledge financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/us-climate-envoy-kerry-seoul-climate-discussions-77135062", "date": "April 17, 2021, 11:22 AM"}
