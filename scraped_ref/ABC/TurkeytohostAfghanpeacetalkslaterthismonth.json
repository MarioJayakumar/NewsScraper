The conference will be held between April 24 and May 4, the ministry said.The surprise announcement came after a Taliban spokesman said Monday the religious militia would not attend a peace conference that had been tentatively planned to take place in Turkey later this week, putting U.S. efforts for a peace plan in jeopardy.Soon after Turkey's statement, U.S. officials said President  would withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on America. The attacks were coordinated from Afghanistan.The decision defies a May 1 deadline for full withdrawal under a peace agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban last year. Biden had hinted for weeks he was going to let the deadline lapse, and it became clear that an orderly withdrawal of the remaining 2,500 troops was unlikely.The Taliban have warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if Washington reneges on the deal and the withdrawal timeline.The Turkish Foreign Ministry did not provide detailed information on the conference's expected participants. It said the aim of the meeting would be to \u201caccelerate and complement the ongoing intra-Afghan negotiations\u201d that have been taking place in Doha, Qatar and to achieve a \u201cjust and durable political settlement.\u201dIt said the conference agenda was the \u201csubject of extensive consultations with the Afghan parties.\u201d\u201cThe conference will focus on helping the negotiating parties reach a set of shared, foundational principles that reflect an agreed vision for a future Afghanistan, a roadmap to a future political settlement and an end to the conflict,\u201d the ministry said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkey-host-afghan-peace-talks-month-77046318", "date": "April 13, 2021, 2:15 PM"}
