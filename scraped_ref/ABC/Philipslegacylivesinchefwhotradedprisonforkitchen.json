But he says it was a program founded by , the Duke of Edinburgh, that gave him a \u201cpassion for \u201d and a career as a chef when he got out of prison 3 1/2 years later.\u201cI was a young boy in prison,\u201d Watts, now 32, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt helped mold me to be what I like to think is a good person, and it set me up to believe in myself, to believe that I can achieve things.\u201dAfter         Philip\u2019s death last week  at age 99, politicians and world leaders         rushed to eulogize his lifetime of service to his wife,         Queen Elizabeth II, and to the British nation. For many people across the country, though, his greatest contribution was the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award, a program which seeks to give young people the skills and confidence they need to succeed.Participants in the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award must complete volunteer work, improve their physical fitness, learn new skills, and go on expeditions to earn each of three progressively more difficult levels of achievement \u2014 bronze, silver and gold. More than 6.7 million people between the ages of 14 and 24 have taken part in the U.K., and the program has expanded to 130 countries since Philip founded it in 1956.The program has become such a part of British life that members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Cabinet recently regaled each other with tales of how they earned gold awards. Johnson, however, joked that some may have exaggerated their achievements.\u201cI will leave it to the House to speculate as to who claimed to have got a gold award, and who got a bronze,\u201d Johnson told British lawmakers in the House of Commons this week. \u201cBut I believe those ministers spoke for millions of people \u2013 across this country and around the world \u2013 who felt that the duke had in some way touched their lives.\u201dThe award grew out of Philip\u2019s own experience at Gordonstoun school in Scotland, where he earned a similar prize called the Moray Badge before World War II. After the war, headmaster Kurt Hahn approached his former student with the idea of expanding the program to give young people around the U.K. a sense of achievement through out-of-classroom learning experiences.While the program allows young people to pursue their own interests and design their own challenges, the unifying element is that it is intended to push them to test their limits, building confidence and developing independence along the way, said Luke Levine, 23, who earned a gold award before becoming a volunteer for the organization.For his final expedition, Levine was part of a group that took a three-day trek through Snowdonia National Park in Wales, battling high winds and bad weather as they climbed a 3,000-foot mountain and assisted a team member struggling with asthma. That sense of self-reliance helped make it possible for Levine to come out as a transgender man.\u201cI just felt like I was in a place where I was learning to be confident, \u2026\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI think that really helps me, kind of, in my coming out journey.\u201dWatts had his own journey to complete.He said that after leaving school at 16 with no qualifications, he got involved with gangs in his hometown of Oxford. After an incident in which another young man was stabbed, Watts was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison.He decided to pursue the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award after hearing a talk by representatives of the Reading Football Club, which provided funding for the program at the prison.Two prison officers helped him design a program that roughly followed a national vocational cooking course. He learned all the basics, from good kitchen hygiene to how to scale a fish. For the community service section, he volunteered for the Samaritans crisis line, answering calls from people struggling with suicidal thoughts.Watts\u2019 first expedition was an overnight on the prison soccer field with guards keeping watch. After moving to the prison\u2019s resettlement unit in preparation for release, Watts and other prisoners were allowed to plan proper journeys through the Chiltern Hills near London and in the Brecon Beacons, a rugged Welsh mountain range where British soldiers do survival training.Watts says that when he met Philip at a reception for young people receiving their awards, the duke unleashed one of his famously politically incorrect comments, asking whether he had to wear a \u201cball and chain\u201d on his expedition. Watts didn\u2019t take offense.\u201cI thought that was quite funny, just because meeting Prince Philip is quite an overwhelming experience for anyone at any time,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt made me laugh, and I think that was his aim.\u201dAs he prepared for release from release from prison, Watts went to work at one of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s restaurants while on daily furlough.He had to sidestep offers to go to the pub after closing time.Once released, he spent five years with Oliver, then left to set up his own catering business, which won corporate and event contracts. With those jobs on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, he now works as a chef for three private families and shows off recipes such as crispy chili beef with noodles, truffled chicken Milanese, and tear \u2019n\u2019 share garlic bread on social media.Even though his years in prison are long behind him, and it would be possible for him to obscure his past, Watts keeps talking about those hard times so others who are struggling will know all is not lost.After all, that\u2019s what being a gold award winner really means.\u201cI am a part of his legacy,\u2019\u2019 Watts said of the late Duke of Edinburgh. \u201cEvery day when I\u2019m working and when I\u2019m cooking food and putting that food on to a plate, maybe it\u2019s a bit far-fetched, but that\u2019s a bit of Prince Philip\u2019s legacy as well.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014For AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip go to         https://apnews.com/hub/prince-philip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/philips-legacy-lives-chef-traded-prison-kitchen-77113903", "date": "April 16, 2021, 10:00 AM"}
