Among those standing in one crowd was retired police officer Paul Smart.\u201cThe volcano caught us with our pants down, and it\u2019s very devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cNo water, lots of dust in our home. We thank God we are alive, but we need more help at this moment.\u201dPrime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a press conference on local station NBC Radio that St. Vincent will need hundreds of millions of dollars to recover from the eruption but did not give any details.He added that no casualties have been reported since the first big blast from the volcano early Friday. \u201cWe have to try and keep that record,\u201d he said. Gonsalves said some people have refused to leave communities closest to the volcano and urged them to evacuate.Falling ash and pyroclastic flows have destroyed crops and contaminated water reservoirs. Garth Saunders, minister of the island\u2019s water and sewer authority, noting that some communities have not yet received water.\u201cThe windward (eastern) coast is our biggest challenge today,\u201d he said during the press conference of efforts to deploy water trucks. \u201cWhat we are providing is a finite amount. We will run out at some point.\u201dThe prime minister said people in some shelters need  and water, and he thanked neighboring nations for shipments of items including cots, respiratory masks and water bottles and tanks. In addition, the World Bank has disbursed $20 million to the government of St. Vincent as part of an interest-free catastrophe financing program.Adam Billing, a retired police officer who lived and tended to his crops on land near the volcano, said he had more than 3 acres of plantains, tannias, yams and a variety of fruits and estimates he lost more than $9,000 worth of crops.\u201cEverything that (means) livelihood is gone. Everything,\u201d said Billing, who was evacuated. \u201cWe have to look at the next couple of months as it's not going to be a quick fix from the government.\u201dThe volcano, which had seen a low-level eruption since December, experienced the first of several major explosions on Friday morning, and volcanologists say activity could continue for weeks.Another explosion was reported Tuesday morning, sending another massive plume of ash into the air. It came on the anniversary of the 1979 eruption, the last one produced by the volcano until Friday morning. A previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people.\u201cIt\u2019s still a pretty dangerous volcano,\u201d said Richard Robertson with the University of the West Indies\u2019 Seismic Research Center. \u201cIt can still cause serious damage.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Coto reported from San Juan, .
