The life of Alexey Navalny and the fate of Russia depends on how many citizens come out to the streets this Wednesday,\u201d Navalny\u2019s team .Doctors helping Navalny\u2019s family said on Saturday blood tests showed his potassium levels are \u201ccatastrophically\u201d high, meaning that he could suffer heart failure at \"any moment.\" One of the doctors, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said the tests also suggested that Navalny\u2019s kidneys are now shutting down.In such a condition, Ashikhmin , a patient would normally be moved to an intensive care unit.\"People usually avoid using the word 'dying,'\" Navalny\u2019s spokesperson Kira Yarmysh wrote on Facebook Saturday. \u201cMe personally because I don\u2019t like throwing such big statements around. But right now Alexey is dying. In his state, it is a matter of days.\u201dDeclaration of  on behalf of the EU on the deteriorating health of Alexei .The EU is deeply concerned and calls on the Russian authorities to grant him immediate access to medical professionals he trusts. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbYarmysh and other members of Navalny\u2019s team said they now fear that the Kremlin has decided to put an end to the challenge posed by him, by allowing him to die out of sight in the prison camp. Navalny's doctors again sought to visit him Sunday but said they were denied entry.On Friday, Russian prosecutors moved to have Navalny\u2019s key organizations declared \"extremist groups,\" which would outlaw his movement and put anyone supporting him at risk of lengthy prison sentences. The request to ban the groups -- the Anti-Corruption Foundation and Navalny\u2019s regional campaign headquarters -- is the most serious attempt yet to destroy Navalny's movement.The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Sunday issued a statement expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Navalny\u2019s condition and demanding that the Kremlin grant immediate medical access to him. The bloc\u2019s foreign ministers will discuss the situation at a meeting on Monday, it said in a statement.The U.S. State Department also called for Russia to immediately give Navalny access to medical care.Russian authorities are responsible for Aleksey Navalny's well-being, and we call on them to allow him access to necessary medical care immediately in response to disturbing reports his health is deteriorating.\"Russian authorities are responsible for Aleksey Navalny's well-being, and we call on them to allow him access to necessary medical care immediately in response to disturbing reports his health is deteriorating,\" the department's spokesperson Ned Price wrote on Twitter.Before Navalny fell ill, his allies had planned to hold a mass protest this spring once 500,000 people registered on a website saying they were ready to take part. But on Sunday, Navalny\u2019s team said they could no longer wait given how critical the situation was.The team called for protests in the central squares of every Russian city at 7 p.m. local time, coinciding with the same day that Putin is due to give an annual state-of-the-nation address.In January, the Kremlin was able to shut down protests that broke out after Navalny returned to Russia and was jailed on parole violations that have been widely condemned as politically motivated. After police , Navalny\u2019s team was forced to call for further demonstrations. The plan to gather 500,000 online registrations was intended to ensure protests were large enough to have an impact, but Navalny\u2019s decline has upended that plan.Observers in Moscow said they feared that Russia having weathered the protests in January and only having received symbolic sanctions from Western countries over Navalny\u2019s jailing, the Kremlin may have concluded it can now allow him to die.\"The danger is that the collective Kremlin may have decided to end the Navalny problem once and for all: he may die in detention, and his infrastructure will be destroyed. Protests? They can be suppressed and will go into decline,\u201d Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter.Navalny's team said said next week's protests have become a final showdown with the Kremlin to stop Navalny's death and prevent the complete destruction of a democratic opposition in Russia.\"if we are silent now then the darkest time will come for free people,\" Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, two top Navalny aides, said in a video posted Sunday. \"Russia will sink into total darkness.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-alexey-navalny-dying-prison-allies-call-nationwide/story?id=77151163", "date": "April 18, 2021, 2:47 PM"}
