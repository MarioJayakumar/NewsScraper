Diplomats from the world powers have been shuttling between the Iranian delegation and an American one, which is also in Vienna but not talking directly with the Iranian side.Two expert groups have been brainstorming solutions to the two major issues: The rollback of American sanctions on one hand, and Iran's return to compliance on the other.Now, said Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov, \u201cwe can note with satisfaction that the negotiations (are) entering the drafting stage.\u201d\u201cPractical solutions are still far away, but we have moved from general words to agreeing on specific steps towards the goal,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Already on Saturday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that Tehran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiations.\u201cWe think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,\u201d Araghchi told Iranian state television. \u201cIt seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.\u201d\u201dThe path is better known, but it will not be easy path,\u201d Araghchi added. \u201cIt does not mean that differences of views have come to the end.\u201dBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told Fox News Sunday that the Vienna talks had been \u201cconstructive,\u201d but he wouldn't give specific details on the proposals.\u201cWhat I will say is that the United States is not going to lift sanctions unless we have clarity and confidence that Iran will fully return to compliance with its obligations under the deal,\u201d he said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted by the country's official IRNA news agency Monday as saying that there was \u201csome progress in the talks, but it doesn't mean the resolution of differences.\u201d\u201cWe think the U.S. administration knows better than anyone that Iran's actions are within the framework of the nuclear deal and they will be halted when the U.S. lifts sanctions and we can verify that,\u201d he said.The ultimate goal of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn\u2019t want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.Challenges also remain outside of the negotiations.An attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel recently struck Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear site, causing an unknown amount of damage. Tehran retaliated by beginning to enrich a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level ever. International inspections also could be disrupted without an agreement.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/delegate-progress-iran-nuclear-talks-end-77160292", "date": "April 19, 2021, 6:39 AM"}
