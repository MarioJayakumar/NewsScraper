A disc-shaped weight rests on a towel covering one of the 25 volunteer\u2019s bare back while researchers monitored the effect on his heart.The researchers acknowledged that limitations included the generally healthy volunteers between the ages of 22 and 42 and the study\u2019s controlled environment. They tested weights totaling 50 and 100 pounds (23 and 46 kilograms) and acknowledged it\u2019s \u201cpossible larger amounts of force are used in actual practice in the field.\u201d The source of the study's funding was not provided.A spokeswoman for UC San Diego Health on Wednesday said the researchers declined to speak with The Associated Press about their work and its role in the trial.A retired medical examiner testifying for the defense, Dr. David Fowler, also described a Canadian law enforcement study on the use of prone positioning during arrests; it found no fatalities among about 3,000 arrests. That information was provided by police officers and the Canadian government paid for the research.The study's authors said they didn't know how long officers held suspects in the prone position or whether the officers used their bodyweight to hold them down.WHAT DO CRITICS SAY?Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, said he has testified opposite the authors of several of the studies referenced during Chauvin\u2019s trial. Alpert considers them flawed recreations of interactions between police and citizens.He said police agencies have adopted training that recommends limiting the amount of time someone spends in the prone position \u2014 a clear sign that it is dangerous.The U.S. Department of Justice warned agencies of the risks more than 25 years ago. Among the recommendations in that 1995 bulletin: \u201cAs soon as the suspect is handcuffed, get him off his stomach.\u201dAlpert recalled the words of a police trainer in Florida: \u201cThe ground is your friend and then it becomes angry.\u201dMinneapolis committed to training officers on the dangers of         positional asphyxia in a $3 million settlement following the 2010 death of David Smith, whom officers subdued with a Taser and pinned face down for minutes.Dr. Steven Bird, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said restraining and weighing down volunteers is \u201ccompletely different\u201d to police holding handcuffed suspects to the ground.\u201cYou can\u2019t do a study that would adequately recapitulate the circumstances under which the patient died in restraint,\u201d he said.WHY DOES IT MATTER?Legal experts say the case against Chauvin boils down to two questions: Did his actions cause Floyd\u2019s death? Were those actions reasonable?Nelson says Chauvin did what he was trained to do and that Floyd\u2019s drug use and underlying health conditions caused his death. He's hoping jurors will agree the research supports those arguments.But several prosecution experts testified that Floyd died due to lack of oxygen because of how the officers were holding him down. Even         the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s chief said  Floyd should not have been pinned to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes. Police officials also said Minneapolis officers are trained to turn suspects on their sides once handcuffed to ease breathing.One use-of-force expert said no \u201creasonable\u201d officer would have done what Chauvin did.HOW ARE PROSECUTORS HANDLING THE RESEARCH?Dr. Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital and Loyola University\u2019s medical school in Illinois who was called as a witness by the prosecution, testified that the research involving weights on volunteers' backs \u201chighly misleading.\u201dThe force of an officer\u2019s knee, Tobin said, is 10 times greater than a large, flat weight spread over a volunteer\u2019s upper back, and no study has pressed a weight onto someone's neck.\u201cI suspect you\u2019d have major trouble getting that through the ethics committee in any medical school,\u201d Tobin said.Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell on Wednesday aggressively questioned the studies\u2019 relevance to Floyd's experience, getting Fowler, the former medical examiner, to acknowledge that the research did not examine the effect of a knee pressing into someone\u2019s neck or keep weight on subjects for the same length of time Floyd was kept on the ground.\u2014\u2014\u2014Find AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at:         https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/explainer-chauvin-defense-suggests-prone-position-risky-77077935", "date": "April 14, 2021, 8:18 PM"}
