After departing the hearing room, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told reporters he did not agree with Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw, saying the U.S. intelligence agencies will \"lose a lot of that capability in the very near future based on the president's decision.\"Beyond the proposed troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, senators on Wednedsay peppered intelligence community leaders with queries about a broad spectrum of threats facing the U.S., including the \"unparalleled threat\" posed by China\u2019s geopolitical ambitions, according to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.The spy chiefs also discussed how fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to threaten governments, the nuclear challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, and Russia\u2019s escalating cyber operations.After Haines concluded her opening statement, the committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., retorted, \"that was a list of about as many awful things in 10 minutes as I may have heard in recent times.\"Once an annual event, the Worldwide Threats hearings took a hiatus in 2020 after intelligence community leaders reportedly balked at depicting a national security landscape in conflict with the sentiments conveyed by then-President Donald Trump.Their 2019 testimony, which contradicted Trump\u2019s rosy vision of relations with Iran, attracted scrutiny on the then-president\u2019s now-dormant Twitter page.On Thursday, the leaders of the intelligence community -- including Burns, Haines and the directors of the FBI, National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency -- will return to Capitol Hill to field questions from the House Intelligence Committee.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-troop-withdrawal-invites-significant-risk-terrorism-resurgence/story?id=77066689", "date": "April 14, 2021, 2:14 PM"}
