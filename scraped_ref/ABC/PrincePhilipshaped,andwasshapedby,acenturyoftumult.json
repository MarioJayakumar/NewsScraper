When he was a toddler, his family had to flee Greece after a coup. Monarchies across Europe were being toppled as societies faced upheaval in the aftermath of World War I and the deadly influenza pandemic that followed.His grandfather, King George of Greece, had been assassinated eight years before Philip\u2019s birth, and his royal Romanov relatives in Russia were slain after the czar's abdication and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\u201cIt was a time when a lot of what had seemed like very stable institutions and countries were simply disappearing,\u201d MacMillan said. \u201cThere was a lot of fear that what had happened in Russia was going to spread around the world.\u201dHistorian Ed Owens said Philip\u2019s early years \u201care key to informing how he sees monarchy for the rest of his life.\u201dHe said Philip saw monarchy \u201cas something that isn\u2019t necessarily permanent, that must be kept popular.\u201dRaised by relatives in Britain, Philip joined the Royal Navy and saw action in World War II on battleships in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Pacific. European royalty found itself divided by the war: Two of Philip\u2019s sisters had German husbands who served on the Nazi side.He had a ringside seat for the end of the conflict. Philip\u2019s ship was in Tokyo Bay for the formal Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945, and he watched the ceremony through binoculars.In 1947, Philip married Britain\u2019s Princess Elizabeth, who as the elder daughter of King George VI was destined to be queen.British historian Simon Schama said that coming from \u201ca Europe where nothing seemed stable,\u201d Philip embraced the solidity offered by Britain\u2019s monarchy and its role as neutral pillar of public life, above the political fray.\u201cWhen he found his way into British life \u2026 he wasn\u2019t just embracing a royal family, he was embracing an institution, that of constitutional monarchy,\u201d Schama told the BBC.When Elizabeth became queen at age 25 in 1952, Philip gave up his naval career and dedicated himself to supporting her.Britain, though victorious in the war, was an indebted and declining power whose colonies were breaking free. Philip helped create the Commonwealth group of nations, with the queen at its head, to try to bind Britain and its former colonies together on a more equal footing.Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said in a tribute that Philip sought to bring the \u201ccamaraderie and comradeship\u201d he had experienced as a wartime sailor into relations between countries, \u201cso that they would reap the dividends of collaboration in peacetime too.\u201dThe royal couple covered 40,000 miles touring the Commonwealth in 1953, the first of many trips to the organization\u2019s now 54 member nations.\u201cHis Royal Highness had a farsighted understanding of the potential of Commonwealth connection, and his approaches to bringing people together from a wide range of backgrounds to develop leadership skills were regarded as innovative and brave,\u201d Scotland said.In Britain, Philip helped steer the monarchy through decades of declining social deference into a mass-media world where people demand intimacy from their icons.He was instrumental in ensuring the queen\u2019s coronation was televised. Many British families bought TV sets just for the occasion, and it became the country\u2019s first mass television spectacle.\u201cVery early on, he saw the \u2026 positive benefits of mass media as a way of enhancing the monarchy\u2019s public image,\u201d Owens said.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about Philip as quite a sort of old-fashioned presence, certainly at the end of his life. But actually, from the moment he becomes a British royal in 1947, he\u2019s a real modernizing force.\u201dPhilip was also an early environmentalist and a champion of technology. Prime Minister Boris Johnson noted Monday that Philip was \u201cone of the first people in this country to use a mobile phone.\u201d In his late 90s, he was making Zoom calls on a laptop, according to his grandson, Prince Harry.The decades brought family troubles, played out in public: the divorces of three of Philip and the queen\u2019s four children; the death of Princess Diana in 1997; Prince Andrew\u2019s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier who died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges; and the self-exile of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, amid allegations of racism both from the media and within the royal household.Yet almost 70 years after Elizabeth became queen, she is a beloved figure \u2014 the only monarch most Britons have known \u2014 and republicanism is favored by a small minority in the country. The monarchy appears to be safe.But with Britain facing an uneasy new relationship with its European neighbors, Scottish nationalists pushing for an independence vote and Brexit shaking the peace process in Northern Ireland, the future of both crown and country is uncertain. The queen is 94, and some day will be succeeded by her son, Prince Charles, a far less-popular royal.\u201cThere\u2019s the issue of the royal family \u2014 what\u2019s its future? Then there\u2019s the issue of Britain \u2014 what\u2019s its future?\u201d MacMillan said. \u201cI think there\u2019s now a big question about the future of the international order. Are we seeing a period of transition?\u201cPhilip\u2019s life bookends that great moment of transition at the end of the First World War and, perhaps, a really big moment of transition in the aftermath of the Cold War.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press Writer Danica Kirka contributed.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/prince-philip-shaped-shaped-century-tumult-77038437", "date": "April 13, 2021, 3:27 AM"}
