We believe there is not only a defense to these charges but a very good defense to these charges,\u201d Effman said. \u201cWe believe that it will result in an acquittal once this trial commences and concludes in California.\"\u201cBut the reality is Mr. Weinstein is serving a 23-year term at a maximum security facility in New York state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know he's not going anywhere.\u201dErie County Assistant District Attorney Colleen Curtin Gable took issue with Effman's suggestion that there is no hurry.\u201cAs far as what's humanitarian to all people involved, including the victims in this case, the time is of the essence,\" she said.District Attorney John Flynn later called Effman's delay over paperwork \u201ca sandbag move\u201d that could have been resolved earlier.Weinstein did not speak during the hearing as he sat at a table with his hands folded in front of him, but appeared to be in good spirits as he chatted with his attorney before the proceeding got underway.Effman said he wanted to delay the extradition so that Weinstein could undergo two scheduled medical procedures, an eye surgery and a dental procedure, but that California prosecutors denied his requests.\u201cHe is almost technically blind at this point and in need of surgery,\u201d according to the lawyer, who added Weinstein also had lost four teeth while behind bars.The Hollywood producer's lawyers have appealed his 2020 conviction, arguing in court papers         last week  that Manhattan Judge James Burke swayed the trial\u2019s outcome with repeated rulings favorable to prosecutors and that the 23-year prison sentence Burke imposed was \u201cunduly harsh and excessive.\u201dA jury found Weinstein guilty of raping an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting a production assistant at his apartment in 2006 by forcibly performing oral sex on her.He was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault stemming from actor Annabella Sciorra\u2019s allegations of a mid-1990s rape.The extradition hearing had been delayed since August because of the pandemic.Weinstein survived a bout with the  in March at the prison. His lawyers said he experienced symptoms of COVID-19 again in mid-November but did not test positive for the disease at that time.\u2014\u2014\u2014Dalton reported from Los Angeles.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/weinstein-challenges-extradition-face-california-charges-77028610", "date": "April 12, 2021, 6:08 PM"}
