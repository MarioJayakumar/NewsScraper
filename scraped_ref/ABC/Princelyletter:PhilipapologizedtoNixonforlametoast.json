{"title": "Princely letter: Philip apologized to Nixon for 'lame' toast", "body": "Prince Philip was known for occasional off-the-cuff remarks that could be embarrassingWASHINGTON -- Throughout his decades in public life,          was known for putting his royal foot in his mouth with occasional off-the-cuff remarks that could be embarrassing. But his faux pas at a White House dinner with President Richard Nixon in 1969 was enough for Philip to actually lose sleep.In a handwritten note to the president uncovered by archivists at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, the Duke of Edinburgh wrote to \u201chumbly apologize\" for failing to toast the president's  as dictated by protocol during a \u201cstag\u201d dinner in his honor.\"After the brilliance of the other speakers and yourself, I am afraid my contribution was very lame,\u201d Philip wrote to Nixon from Greenland on Nov. 7 after his solo U.S. trip had concluded. He added: \u201cThat night I woke up in a cold sweat when I realized I had forgotten to propose your health!\u201dPhilip died last week at age 99, and         his funeral is Saturday. He was married to Queen Elizabeth for 73 years.\u201cI think the letter itself shows the character of Prince Philip that so much of the public in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, and really across the world, have come to admire,\u201d said Jim Byron, executive vice president of the Nixon Foundation. He said the letter was discovered before the coronavirus pandemic but made public this week, as a way of marking Philip's death.\u201cIt expresses some private feelings of a moment in time that the public really doesn\u2019t always get a chance to see,\u201d Byron added.Known for his quick wit and willingness to be self-deprecating, Philip's brand of cheekiness         didn't always go over well,  and sometimes veered into racism. In 1995, he asked a Scottish driving instructor, \u201cHow do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?\u201d Seven years later in Australia, when visiting Aboriginal people with the queen, he asked: \u201cDo you still throw spears at each other?\u201dWhile visiting a military barracks, Philip asked a sea cadet instructor if she worked in a strip club, and even said to a woman who had lost two sons in a fire that smoke detectors were \"a damn nuisance. I\u2019ve got one in my bathroom, and every time I run my bath, the steam sets it off.\u201dDuring White House dinners, honored guests usually offer a toast to the president's health and success. Philip wrote to Nixon that he couldn't \u201cbegin to tell you how much I appreciated your very great kindness and hospitality at the White House. I was quite overwhelmed by the guests but delighted to meet such a distinguished company.\u201dHe mentioned having then traveled to New York, where he was interviewed by Barbara Walters for NBC's \u201cToday\" show.\u201cThe weather in New York was horrible but otherwise all went well,\u201d Philip wrote, \u201cand I found Miss Walters particularly charming and intelligent. I hope we did a good piece.\u201dThe long guest list for the dinner was all-male. It included Vice President Spiro Agnew, most of the members of Nixon's Cabinet and nongovernmental notables like business magnate Ross Perot and Britain-born comedian Bob Hope.Byron said Nixon almost certainly replied to Philip's letter, but, with the library archives remaining closed because of the pandemic, what he might have said is unknown. What Philip said in his remarks \u2014 other than omitting wishing Nixon good health \u2014 is unknown for the same reason.The dinner came a day after Nixon delivered his famous \u201csilent majority\u201d speech in which he implored a national audience to unite behind the continuing war in Vietnam until his administration could achieve \u201cpeace with honor.\u201d Byron said top aide H.R. Haldeman, who later went to prison for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, noted in his diary how absolutely joyful the president was that night, given that his address had been positively received.Nixon, who died at age 81 in 1994, was a bit older than Philip, but the two had known each other for years by then. As vice president, Nixon and his wife met with Queen Elizabeth and Philip in London. The Nixons gave the royal couple a tour of Washington's sites when they made a state visit to the U.S. in 1959.\u201cPhilip, by all measures, he was being kind,\" Byron said of the letter. \u201cAnd really expressing so much of his character.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/princely-letter-philip-apologized-nixon-lame-toast-77110733", "date": "April 16, 2021, 11:36 AM"}
