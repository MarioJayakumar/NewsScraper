News reports identified the hedge fund as New York-based Archegos Capital Management.\u201cFollowing the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions,\u201d the company said.The Financial Times reported that Archegos had large exposures to ViacomCBS and several Chinese technology stocks and was hit hard after shares of the U.S. media group fell last week.A margin call is triggered when investors borrow using their stock portfolio as collateral and have to make up the balance required by banks when the share prices fall and the collateral is worth less.Credit Suisse said that \u201cwhile at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first-quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month.\u201d Credit Suisse said that it plans to issue an update \u201cin due course.\u201dNomura said that on Friday \u201can event occurred\u201d that could subject one of its U.S. subsidiaries to a losss of $2 billion based on market prices on Friday.
