It would be (expletive) awesome,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI feel like a team that\u2019s gone to the World Series for decades and decades, and never wins.\u201dA triumph would be especially sweet for the veteran songwriter whose first Oscar bid was in 1988 (for the romcom \u201cMannequin\u201d). The  ceremony, originally set for February and delayed by the pandemic, airs April 25, the birthday of her late father, David Warren, and a coincidence that she calls \u201cso cool.\u201d\u201cHe believed in me so much he would take me to music publishers when I was 14 or 15,\u201d Warren said. \u201cMy mom would be saying, \u2018Why are you doing it? Why are you encouraging her? She can\u2019t make a living off that.\u2019\u201dWarren, who grew up in Los Angeles, recounted her dad\u2019s reply: \u201cShe has talent. She really, really wants this.\u201dHer gifts and drive led to success in a range of pop music genres and in film, with her past Oscar contenders including \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing,\u201d by Aerosmith and featured in 1998\u2019s \u201cArmageddon.\u201d It was a hit tune, one of Warren\u2019s many that include \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\" by Cher. Toss out a big name \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga \u2014 and Warren has likely worked with them.She's a confessed workaholic who typically writes solo but joined with Common on the 2019 Oscar-nominated \u201cStand Up for Something\u201d for \u201cMarshall,\u201d a biopic about the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\u201cThe Life Ahead\u201d brought a new form of collaboration. Warren had written the music and words for the song when director Edoardo Ponti \u2014 Loren\u2019s son \u2014 realized the Italian-language film needed lyrics to match. Italian pop star-songwriter Laura Pausini was brought in for the task and shares the Oscar nomination.Warren's music and lyrics are \u201camazing,\" said Pausini, who recorded \u201cIo Si\u201d for the film. The song and the movie carry the same message, \"and that\u2019s the goal.\u201dIn \u201cThe Life Ahead,\u201d Loren plays the aged Madame Rosa, a former prostitute and Holocaust survivor who helps sex workers by taking in their children. She reluctantly adds an orphaned, street-tough Senegalese youngster known as Momo to her small brood, and the pair move gradually from distrust to love. Impressive newcomer Ibrahima Gueye, himself an immigrant to Italy from Senegal, plays the boy.The third movie adaptation of the 1975 Romain Gary novel \u201cThe Life Before Us\u201d is a wrenchingly tender story of those who live on the margins of \u2014 and largely are invisible to \u2014 society, which prompted Warren's approach to the song.\u201cThe first thing I came up with, sitting at my piano, was, \u2018I want you to know that you\u2019re seen,' she said, breaking briefly into an a cappella performance. \u201cIt's so simple but it's so profound, because we all want to be seen.\u201dThe song became an integral part of the movie, heard in its translated version over the closing scene. Filmmaker Ponti gladly gives credit to Warren, who approached him in 2019 before \u201cThe Life Ahead\u201d went into production with Ponti's legendary mother.\u201cI hadn't even considered having a song in the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had gotten ahold of the script and something clicked for her. So when something clicks for Diane Warren, you just say, \u2018Absolutely, I would love a song in my movie because Diane Warren is a great artist.'\u201dWhen Warren came to his Los Angeles-area home early last year to introduce her creation, she was wearing a cast from a household accident, recalled Ponti, a writer as well as stage and screen director.\u201cWith her broken hand and her guitar, she sang the song in my living room,\u201d he said, recalling it as a \u201ca very bright day\u201d in the up-and-down experience of bringing a movie to fruition.It's a clich\u00e9, but Warren says being nominated truly is an honor. Of the many songs introduced in movies each year, she said, a mere five are singled out by the academy\u2019s music branch with \u201cthe best composers on the planet, the best songwriters, the best of the best of the best.\u201dThe other contenders include \u201cSpeak Now\u201d from \u201cOne Night in Miami...\u201d written by Leslie Odom Jr., a supporting actor nominee for the film, and Sam Ashworth.Whatever happens on Oscars night, Warren believes \u201cIo Si (Seen)\u201d is destined to become an evergreen covered by other artists. She's seen it happen often enough, but remains far from jaded by her work's influence.\u201cI sit in my little room all by myself (writing), and somehow the song touches people and makes them cry and makes them feel something,\" she said. \"It\u2019s always amazing.\u201d", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/12-time-oscar-nominee-diane-warren-hopes-awesome-77091498", "date": "April 15, 2021, 4:10 PM"}
