The United States, Brazil and  have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.Speaking to reporters during a visit to , Kluge did point to \u201cearly signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries\u201d in WHO's 53-country European region, which stretches into Central Asia \u2014and cited \u201cdeclining incidence\u201d among the oldest people.He said the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people over 80, who have been prioritized for vaccines, had dropped to nearly 30% \u2014 the lowest level in the pandemic.Britain in particular has seen new infections and COVID-19 deaths drop dramatically since January, due to a successful vaccination program and a prolonged national lockdown that is only being reversed in stages.Addressing recent concerns about vaccines, Kluge also said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than for people who receive AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine.\u201cLet there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalization and preventing deaths,\u201d he said, adding that WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic  and         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/europe-surpassed-million-covid-19-deaths-77088387", "date": "April 15, 2021, 8:15 AM"}
