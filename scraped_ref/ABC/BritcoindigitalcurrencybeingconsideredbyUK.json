However, digital currencies, like the one being considered in the U.K. are different in a key sense to Bitcoin as they are issued by state authorities.\u201cThe world is going the way of digital currencies and we have to find a place for them in the mainstream,\u201d said Anne Boden, founder and chief executive of app-based Starling Bank.One of the benefits of a digital currency would be as a backup to card payments if cash payments continue to drop in the years to come \u2014 by the end of this decade, only one in 10 payments in the U.K. are expected to be made with traditional paper money. Proponents of digital currencies also think they can provide another way for people to make purchases online.Currently, only the Bahamas has such a currency, though China is trialing it in several cities. Sweden has indicated it could have its own digital currency by 2026, while the European Central Bank has indicated an electronic euro might be created within four years.The new British task force is part of a series of measures that Treasury chief Sunak hopes will help the U.K.\u2019s financial technology sector.\u201cOur vision is for a more open, greener, and more technologically advanced financial services sector,\" he told a fintech conference. \"And if we can capture the extraordinary potential of technology, we\u2019ll cement the U .K.\u2019s position as the world\u2019s preeminent financial center.\u201dPromoting Monday's announcement on Twitter, Sunak was brief.\u201cBritcoin?,\u201d he posited.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/britcoin-digital-currency-considered-uk-77162163", "date": "April 19, 2021, 8:30 AM"}
