{"title": "Outdoor AV:  What to consider with unpredictable Kentucky weather", "body": "Ice storm, flooding, and 65\u00b0 all in one month? You must be in Kentucky. When it comes to selecting outdoor electronics for your Kentucky backyard or patio, there\u2019s a couple of things to keep in mind.One of the biggest mistakes people make when creating a backyard entertainment space is using equipment that doesn\u2019t belong outdoors. There are many options for waterproof and weather-resistant TVs, speakers, and other electronic devices that will also maintain quality picture and audio. Outdoor-specific TVs are designed to withstand extreme heat, cold, and insects, and are brighter for full or partial-sun display.Speakers disguised as rocks or garden features aren\u2019t new to the AV game. But , a combination of outdoor-designed speakers, evenly spread through your backyard, will deliver the experience you\u2019re aiming for. Subterranean subwoofers deliver the bass, while bollard-style speakers offer a 360\u00b0 acoustic lens. Coverage, performance, and scalability are endless.The perfect backyard movie needs a good screen and a high-resolution projector. Automated screens and projectors can be hidden in weather-proof enclosures until released with the press of a button, protecting your investment from environmental conditions.Distributed audio/video systems allow you to access audio and video entertainment throughout your home. With this technology, your TV, music and movies aren\u2019t constrained to a single room. Instead, you can move from room to room \u2013 or inside to outside \u2013 without having to pause or miss a beat.Add some automated lighting, commercial-grade wifi, and a universal remote so you never have to get out of the pool!Call !
