{"title": "Murder case against Chauvin in George Floyd\u2019s death goes to jury", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The murder case against former Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd went to the jury Monday in a city on edge against another round of unrest like the one that erupted last year over the video of the Black man with Chauvin\u2019s knee on his neck.The jury of six white people and six people who are Black or multiracial began deliberating after nearly a full day of closing arguments in which prosecutors argued that Chauvin squeezed the life out of Floyd last May in a way that even a child knew was wrong.The defense contended that the now-fired white officer acted reasonably and that the 46-year-old Floyd died of a heart condition and .After closing arguments were done, Judge Peter Cahill rejected a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get more confrontational\u201d if Chauvin isn\u2019t convicted of murder.The judge told Chauvin\u2019s attorney: \u201cCongresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.\u201d He called her comments  and \u201cdisrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch.\u201dChauvin, 45, is  second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, all of which require the jury to conclude that his actions were a \u201csubstantial causal factor\u201d in Floyd\u2019s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.The most serious charge carries up to 40 years in prison.\u201cUse your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,\u201d prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in closing arguments, referring to the bystander video of Floyd pinned to the pavement with Chauvin\u2019s knee on or close to his neck for up to 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as onlookers yelled at the officer to get off.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson countered by arguing that Chauvin did what any reasonable police officer would have done after finding himself in a \u201cdynamic\u201d and \u201cfluid\u201d situation involving a large man struggling with three officers.As Nelson began speaking, the now-fired  removed his  in front of the jury for one of the very few times during the trial.With the case drawing to a close, some stores were boarded up in Minneapolis. The courthouse was ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire, and National Guard members were on patrol. Floyd\u2019s death last spring set off protests in the city and across the U.S. that sometimes turned violent.The city has also been on edge in recent days over the deadly police shooting of a 20-year-old Black man, , in a nearby suburb on April 11.A couple of hundred people rallied outside of the courthouse shortly after the jury got the case, lining up behind a banner reading, \u201cJustice for George Floyd and all stolen lives. The world is watching.\u201dProsecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word Monday, offering the state\u2019s rebuttal argument. The prosecutor, who is Black, said the questions about the use of force and cause of death are \u201cso simple that a child can understand it.\u201d\u201cIn fact, a child did understand it, when the 9-year-old girl said, \u2018Get off of him,\u2019\u201d Blackwell said, referring to a young witness who objected to what she saw. \u201cThat\u2019s how simple it was. `Get off of him.\u2019 Common sense.\u201dUnder the law, police have certain latitude to use force, and their actions are supposed to be judged according to what a \u201creasonable officer\u201d in the same situation would have done.Nelson noted that officers who first went to the corner store where Floyd allegedly passed a counterfeit $20 bill were struggling with Floyd when Chauvin arrived as backup. The defense attorney also noted that the first two officers on the scene were rookies and that police had been told that Floyd might be on drugs.\u201cA reasonable police officer understands the intensity of the struggle,\u201d Nelson said, noting that Chauvin\u2019s body camera and badge were knocked off his chest.Nelson also showed the jury pictures of pills found in Floyd\u2019s SUV and pill remnants discovered in the squad car. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd\u2019s system.The defense attorney said the failure of the prosecution to acknowledge that medical problems or drugs played a role \u201cdefies medical science and it defies common sense and reason.\u201dDuring the prosecution\u2019s argument, Schleicher replayed portions of the bystander video and other footage as he dismissed certain defense theories about Floyd\u2019s death as \u201cnonsense.\u201d He said Chauvin killed Floyd by constricting his breathing.Schleicher rejected the drug overdose argument, as well as the contention that police were distracted by hostile onlookers, that Floyd had \u201csuperhuman\u201d strength from a state of agitation known as , and that he suffered possible carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust.The prosecutor sarcastically referred to the idea that it was heart disease that killed Floyd as an \u201camazing coincidence.\u201d\u201cIs that common sense or is that nonsense?\u201d Schleicher asked the jury.Blackwell, his fellow prosecutor, likewise rejected the defense theory that Floyd died because of an enlarged heart: \u201cThe truth of the matter is that the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin\u2019s heart was too small.\u201dEarlier, Schleicher described how Chauvin ignored Floyd\u2019s cries and continued to kneel on him well after he stopped breathing and had no pulse. Chauvin was \u201con top of him for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and he had to know,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cHe had to know.\u201dHe said Chauvin heard Floyd, \u201cbut he just didn\u2019t listen.\u201dThe prosecutor said Floyd was \u201cnot a threat to anyone\u201d and was not trying to escape when he struggled with officers but instead was terrified of being put into the tiny backseat of the squad car.He said a reasonable officer with Chauvin\u2019s training and experience \u2014 he was a 19-year Minneapolis police veteran \u2014 should have sized up the situation accurately.Chauvin, wearing a light gray suit with a blue shirt and blue tie, showed little expression as he watched himself and the other officers pinning Floyd to the ground on bodycam video played by his attorney. He cocked his head to the side and occasionally leaned forward to write on a notepad.An unidentified woman occupied the single seat set aside in the pandemic-spaced courtroom for a Chauvin supporter.Floyd\u2019s brother Philonise represented the family in court, as he often has during the trial.Schleicher also noted that Chauvin was required to use his training to provide medical care to Floyd but ignored bystanders, rebuffed help from an off-duty paramedic and rejected a suggestion from another officer to roll Floyd onto his side.\u201cHe could have listened to the bystanders. He could have listened to fellow officers. He could have listened to his own training. He knew better. He just didn\u2019t do better,\u201d Schleicher said.___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.
