Mondale, a liberal icon who lost one of the most lopsided presidential elections after bluntly telling voters to expect a tax increase if he won, died Monday. He was 93.The death of the former senator, ambassador and Minnesota attorney general was announced in a statement from his family. No cause was cited.Mondale followed the trail blazed by his political mentor, Hubert H. Humphrey, from Minnesota politics to the U.S. Senate and the vice presidency, serving under Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981.In a statement Monday night, Carter said he considered Mondale \u201cthe best vice president in our country\u2019s history.\u201d He added: \u201cFritz Mondale provided us all with a model for public service and private behavior.\u201dPresident Joe Biden said of Mondale: \u201cThere have been few senators, before or since, who commanded such universal respect. ... It was Walter Mondale who defined the vice presidency as a full partnership, and helped provide a model for my service.\u201dMondale\u2019s own try for the White House, in 1984, came at the zenith of Ronald Reagan\u2019s popularity. His selection of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate made him the first major-party presidential nominee to put a woman on the ticket, but his declaration that he would raise taxes helped define the race.On Election Day, he carried only his home state and the District of Columbia. The electoral vote was 525-13 for Reagan \u2014 the biggest landslide in the Electoral College since Franklin Roosevelt defeated Alf Landon in 1936. (Sen. George McGovern got 17 electoral votes in his 1972 defeat, winning Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.)\u201cI did my best,\u201d Mondale said the day after the election, and blamed no one but himself.\u201cI think you know I\u2019ve never really warmed up to television,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fairness to television, it never really warmed up to me.\u201dYears later, Mondale said his campaign message had proven to be the right one.\u201cHistory has vindicated me that we would have to raise taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very unpopular, but it was undeniably correct.\u201dIn 2002, state and national Democrats looked to Mondale when Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., was killed in a plane crash less than two weeks before Election Day. Mondale agreed to stand in for Wellstone, and early polls showed him with a lead over the Republican candidate, Norm Coleman.But the 53-year-old Coleman, emphasizing his youth and vigor, out-hustled the then-74-year-old Mondale in an intense six-day campaign. Mondale was also hurt by a partisan memorial service for Wellstone, in which thousands of Democrats booed Republican politicians in attendance. One speaker pleaded: \u201cWe are begging you to help us win this election for Paul Wellstone.\u201dPolls showed the service put off independents and cost Mondale votes. Coleman won by 3 percentage points.\u201cThe eulogizers were the ones hurt the most,\u201d Mondale said after the election. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify it, but we all make mistakes. Can\u2019t we now find it in our hearts to forgive them and go on?\u201dIt was a particularly bitter defeat for Mondale, who even after his loss to Reagan had taken solace in his perfect record in Minnesota.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d he said in 1987, \u201cis that not once in my public career did I ever lose an election in Minnesota.\u201dYears after the 2002 defeat, Mondale returned to the Senate to stand beside Democrat Al Franken in 2009 when he was sworn in to replace Coleman after a drawn-out recount and court battle.Mondale started his career in Washington in 1964, when he was appointed to the Senate to replace Humphrey, who had resigned to become vice president. Mondale was elected to a full six-year term with about 54% of the vote in 1966, although Democrats lost the governorship and suffered other election setbacks. In 1972, Mondale won another Senate term with nearly 57% of the vote.His Senate career was marked by advocacy of social issues such as education, housing, migrant workers and child nutrition. Like Humphrey, he was an outspoken supporter of civil rights.Mondale tested the waters for a presidential bid in 1974 but ultimately decided against it. \u201cBasically I found I did not have the overwhelming desire to be president, which is essential for the kind of campaign that is required,\u201d he said in November 1974.In 1976, Carter chose Mondale as No. 2 on his ticket and went on to unseat Gerald Ford.As vice president, Mondale had a close relationship with Carter. He was the first vice president to occupy an office in the White House, rather than in a building across the street. Mondale traveled extensively on Carter\u2019s behalf, and advised him on domestic and foreign affairs.While he lacked Humphrey\u2019s charisma, Mondale had a droll sense of humor.When he dropped out of the 1976 presidential sweepstakes, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the next two years in Holiday Inns.\u201dReminded of that shortly before he was picked as Carter\u2019s running mate, Mondale said, \u201cI\u2019ve checked and found that they\u2019re all redecorated, and they\u2019re marvelous places to stay.\u201dMondale never backed away from his liberal principles.\u201cI think that the country more than ever needs progressive values,\u201d Mondale said in 1989.That year, Democrats tried to persuade him to challenge Minnesota GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, but he decided against making the race, saying it was time to make way for a new generation.\u201cOne of the requirements of a healthy party is that it renews itself,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep running Walter Mondale for everything.\u201dThat paved the way for Wellstone to win the Democratic nomination, and go on to upset Boschwitz. Wellstone had been preparing to take on Mondale in a primary but would have been a heavy underdog.The son of a Methodist minister and a music teacher, Walter Frederick Mondale was born Jan. 5, 1928, in tiny Ceylon, Minnesota, and grew up in several small southern Minnesota towns.He was only 20 when he served as a congressional district manager for Humphrey\u2019s successful Senate campaign in 1948. His education, interrupted by a two-year stint in the Army, culminated with a law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1956.Mondale began a law practice in Minneapolis and ran the successful 1958 gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Orville Freeman, who appointed Mondale state attorney general in 1960. Mondale was elected attorney general in the fall of 1960 and was reelected in 1962.As attorney general, Mondale moved quickly into civil rights, antitrust and consumer protection cases. He was the first Minnesota attorney general to make consumer protection a campaign issue.After his White House years, Mondale served from 1993-96 as President Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to Japan, fighting for U.S. access to markets ranging from cars to cellular phones.He helped avert a trade war in June 1995 over autos and auto parts, persuading Japanese officials to give American automakers more access to Japanese dealers and pushing Japanese carmakers to buy U.S. parts.Mondale kept his ties to the Clintons. In 2008, he endorsed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton for president, switching his allegiance only after Barack Obama sealed the nomination.When Democrats came to him after Wellstone\u2019s death, Mondale was working at the Minneapolis law firm of Dorsey & Whitney and serving on corporate and nonprofit boards. He returned to the firm after the brief campaign.Mondale and his wife, Joan Adams Mondale, were married in 1955. During his vice presidency, she pushed for more government support of the arts and gained the nickname \u201cJoan of Art.\u201d She had minored in art in college and worked at museums in Boston and Minneapolis.The couple had two sons, Ted and William, and a daughter, Eleanor. Ted Mondale served six years in the Minnesota Senate and made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1998. William Mondale served for a time as an assistant attorney general. Eleanor Mondale, who became a broadcast journalist and TV host, died of brain cancer in 2011.Joan Mondale died in 2014 at age 83 after an extended illness.___Former Associated Press writer Brian Bakst contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/20/walter-mondale-carters-vice-president-dies-at-93/", "date": "Published: Apr. 19, 2021 at 9:00 PM EDT"}
