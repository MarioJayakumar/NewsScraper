Jobs are available in hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, local clinics, treatment centers, nursing homes, residential care facilities and outpatient care centers.Students can customize their EKU degree to their interests with one of two concentrations. Health care management will position graduates for entry level staff and management positions that require business expertise and fundamental knowledge of health care. Health informatics and information management focuses on data collection and analysis for administrative decision-making, which is increasingly in demand due to the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs).The health informatics and information management concentration is accredited by The Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM).
