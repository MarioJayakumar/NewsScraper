(WKYT) - It\u2019s a conversation a lot of us don\u2019t want to have, but inevitably we will: end-of-life decisions.Friday is National Healthcare Decision Day and the staff at Bluegrass Care Navigators want to guide us through what can be a difficult discussion.  This is a topic that has, unfortunately, become high-priority due to deaths and scares from COVID-19.\u201cThe statistic is 100 percent of the people who are born die,\u201d said Kristi Yahn, educator at Bluegrass Care Navigators.The staff at Bluegrass Care specializes in hospice care, palliative care and grief counseling.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of are you going to, it\u2019s when and how,\u201d Yahn said.Yahn is talking about a subject that can be uncomfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s like cleaning out the garage, no one wants to do that either,\u201d Yahn said.On this National Healthcare Decision Day, questions are raised about what are your end-of-life wishes. Are you on the same page with your family and doctors with these decisions? What forms do you fill out?They\u2019re called advanced directives.It can be a living will, a medical order for scope for treatment, a form for do not resuscitate to name a few.\u201cIt\u2019s best to have your advance directives in place and then go ahead and enjoy your life,\u201d Yahn said.You can start the paperwork as early as 18. Catastrophe can happen at any age.\u201cWhat if there is something that happens? Suddenly and you are not in a position to speak for your own healthcare wishes,\u201d Yahn said.Yahn says COVID-19 deaths have sped up this tough conversation.\u201cWe were not prepared for it and, now, all the sudden, it\u2019s really really serious and people did not have their directives in place, Yahn said.The topic hits close to home for Yahn. In 2013, Yahn\u2019s husband, David, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. At that point, the family had to quickly fill out his end-of-life wishes before he died.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that once you get it done, it\u2019s so liberating,\u201d Yahn said.Yahn believes pouring over these forms eliminates the potential for family dysfunction and guilt down the road.Most of us like to plan our lives out...except when it comes to the end.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a baby without planning for it, so why don\u2019t we plan for death, why don\u2019t we make it as special as a birth?\u201d Yahn said. Yahn says you should give a copy to your loved ones and your doctor.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/16/its-not-a-matter-of-are-you-going-to-its-when-and-how-making-end-of-life-decisions/", "date": "Published: Apr. 16, 2021 at 3:17 PM EDT"}
