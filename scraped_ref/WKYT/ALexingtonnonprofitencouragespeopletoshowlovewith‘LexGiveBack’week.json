(WKYT) - Compassionate Lexington encourages people to participate in this year\u2019s LexGiveBack week. It runs from April 19 -25. The mission is to help others through acts of kindness.Kory Wilcoxson, the nonprofit organization\u2019s executive director, says acts of kindness can go a long way.\u201cCompassion is so important to so many of us, and yet we don\u2019t always know how to live it out.\u201dCompassionate Lexington is giving people a few ideas. Each day people are encouraged to do something nice.\u201cTuesday is \u2018Tip Big Tuesday.\u2019 When you go out to eat, we hope you\u2019re tipping already, but give a double tip to let those workers know how much you appreciate them,\u201d Wilcoxson said.Later in the week is \u2018Thinking of You Thursday.\u2019 Participants are asked to send at least 10 people a text, email, or written card.Wilcoxson said a week of compassion is needed more than ever before with recent acts of violence. James Pelfrey, who lives in Lexington, agreed.\u201cWhen you see somebody walking at a bus stop, and they\u2019re worn and tired, maybe you should pull over and say, hey, do you need a ride? Can I give you a ride? Don\u2019t make them wait 30 minutes for a bus in the cold weather,\u2019 Pelfrey said.Wilcoxson explained the acts of kindness could be big or small, such as cooking meal for a neighbor or donating to charity.For more information on how to show acts of kindness this week, visit .", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/18/a-lexington-nonprofit-encourages-people-to-show-love-with-lexgiveback-week/", "date": "Published: Apr. 18, 2021 at 3:02 PM EDT"}
