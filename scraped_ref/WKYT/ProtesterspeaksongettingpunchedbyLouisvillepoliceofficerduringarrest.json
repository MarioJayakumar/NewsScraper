During the arrest, six officers forced him to the ground as one officer punched Garrett in his face multiple times.The incident was caught on camera as bystanders recorded while the arrest was being made. The video was shared on Facebook by more than a thousand users.With an eye swollen closed and a leg wrap on, Garrett shared his story Monday afternoon. Garrett said he felt like he could have lost his life during that moment.\u201cI could\u2019ve been a George Floyd yesterday, I could\u2019ve been a Daunte, but God\u2019s grace is good,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s the words of a Black man, that\u2019s powerful, that they want to stop. It\u2019s the words of a Black man that they want to stop. I don\u2019t fear them, and I\u2019m not gone stop protesting.\u201dIn the video, officers told Garrett he was being arrested due to a traffic violation and was blocking traffic while protesting. Garrett was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, according to an arrest citation.\u201cThe message that I had yesterday, I was talking about Rosa Parks,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cRosa Parks stopped going to the back of the bus, she got off work and sat at the first seat that she found and it\u2019s how I feel out here, I\u2019m not going to the back of the bus no more.\u201dPolice Chief Erika Shields responded to the video on Sunday, stating the officer that punched Garrett was now under investigation:\u201cToday LMPD was involved in a use of force incident at Jefferson Square Park while attempting to make an arrest. Social media video of the arrest shows an officer striking a man several times in the face, while he is on the ground. This raises serious questions and is not consistent with LMPD training.\u201cOur officers have to manage difficult situations every day. That\u2019s part of our job. My expectation of officers is to handle these incidents professionally and consistent with their training, every time. I have directed a Professional Standards investigation will be opened immediately into the officer\u2019s conduct as well as the on-scene supervisor.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/19/protester-speaks-on-getting-punched-by-louisville-police-officer-during-arrest/", "date": "Published: Apr. 19, 2021 at 3:45 PM EDT"}
