(WKYT) - The WEDCO District Health Department is holding vaccine clinics for anyone 18 and older who wants to get vaccinated.The department hosts three vaccine clinics per week in Nicholas, Harrison and Scott Counties, Wednesday through Friday.\u201cWe are at the Scott County Library where we\u2019re doing second dose Moderna vaccines, as well as walk-in appointments for first dose,\u201d said Samantha Jones, a clinic nurse administrator for WEDCO.Joes said the trends are changing, but they\u2019re not slowing down.\u201cAt first it was almost like people were knocking down the doors trying to get in trying to get their vaccine. The longer it has went on, the more we\u2019re starting to see vaccine hesitancy,\u201d Jones said.Right now, they\u2019re only giving out the Moderna vaccine. They noticed appointments went down with the pause of Johnson & Johnson rollout.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had the turnout that we thought we would. There\u2019s been a lot of empty appointments and people not showing up,\u201d Jones said.She said walk-ins have been more successful, but she has heard concern about side effects.\u201cWe definitely want people to do their research and to outweigh their risks versus the benefits of the vaccine,\u201d Jones said.With a potential fourth wave hitting the Commonwealth, she and other employees are staying put so people wanting a vaccine know where to find one.\u201cThe more we can get people in here and get them vaccinated, the better we\u2019re all be,\u201d Jones said.She wants fewer doses in the freezer and more shots in arms.Jones said the department had 800 appointments for this clinic. She said that\u2019s a good number for the population, but some people are missing their slot.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/16/wedco-district-health-dept-holding-walk-in-vaccine-clinics-in-scott-county/", "date": "Published: Apr. 16, 2021 at 4:43 PM EDT"}
