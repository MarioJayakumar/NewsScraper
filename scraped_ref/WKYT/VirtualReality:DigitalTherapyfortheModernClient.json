You wear goggles that contain a small video screen through which you see computer-produced images. When you move your head, the images on the screen change as they would in real life. During virtual reality therapy, you can confront a feared object or situation or traumatic event while staying in a safe and comfortable place (i.e., the counseling office).A counselor at TICC helps you talk about your feelings and thoughts throughout the experience, encourages you, and offers suggestions to help you deal with the situation or event.
