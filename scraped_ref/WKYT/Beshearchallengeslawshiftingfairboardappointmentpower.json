Andy Beshear has asked a judge to strike down a Republican-backed law eroding his appointment authority over the state fair board. The measure transferred power to appoint a majority of the board\u2019s members to the agriculture commissioner. The current commissioner is Republican Ryan Quarles. Beshear and a member of his cabinet are challenging the law. Their lawsuit says the majority of appointments to executive branch boards have been reserved for the governor as the state\u2019s chief magistrate under the Kentucky Constitution. Quarles says on social media the governor \u201crefuses to accept laws\u201d enacted by the legislature.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/19/beshear-challenges-law-shifting-fair-board-appointment-power/", "date": "Published: Apr. 19, 2021 at 3:27 PM EDT"}
