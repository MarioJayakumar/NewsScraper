(WYMT) - Preparing students for what comes after school is the message that educators try to send as graduation nears.\u201cBeing prepared for life after high school is a shock to almost any senior,\u201d Kristie Gorman said. \u201cNo senior is really prepared for entering that workforce or going into college as much as they need to be.\u201dExperts say that only six states - Alabama, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Utah - require students to pass personal finance courses to graduate.\u201cIt all depends on allocations, funding,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cIt\u2019s dependent upon each high school, how many teachers they have, what are the graduation requirements they have to offer and then how many staff they have to offer those graduation requirements.\u201dThat does not mean that all hope is lost in the Commonwealth, however.\u201cThere\u2019s this great gap okay, that has to be filled and that has to be filled by the parent,\u201d Gregg Murset said.Murset, the CEO of BusyKid.com, said that a hands-on approach at home can benefit the mind just as much as in-person classes.\u201cEven if kids learned it really good in books at school, okay,\u201d Murset said. \u201cThey\u2019re reading books, they\u2019re watching videos, they\u2019re doing all this stuff. That\u2019s great and that\u2019s a good base, but at the end of the day, I believe kids learn best by doing stuff.\u201dThat is a sentiment that Gorman, the Assistant Superintendent of Perry County Schools, agreed with.\u201cI think parent workshops would help not only the students but it would help the parents as well,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cI think a lot of us don\u2019t realize the demands entering the workforce or financing college.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/17/something-all-of-us-have-to-deal-with-should-kentucky-schools-require-personal-finance-classes/", "date": "Published: Apr. 16, 2021 at 6:12 PM EDT"}
