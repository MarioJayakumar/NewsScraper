(AP) \u2014 Police clashed with protesters for a second night in the Minneapolis suburb where an officer who authorities say apparently intended to fire a Taser, not a handgun, fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop.Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon described the shooting death Sunday of 20-year-old Daunte Wright as \u201can accidental discharge.\u201d The shooting sparked protests and unrest in an area already on edge because of the trial of the first of four police officers charged in George Floyd\u2019s death.Hundreds of protesters faced off against police in Brooklyn Center after nightfall Monday, and hours after a dusk-to-dawn curfew was announced by the governor. When the protesters wouldn\u2019t disperse, police began firing gas canisters and flash-bang grenades, sending clouds wafting over the crowd and chasing some protesters away. A long line of police in riot gear, rhythmically pushing their clubs in front of them, began slowly forcing back the remaining crowds.\u201cMove back!\u201d the police chanted. \u201cHands up! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d the crowd chanted back.By late Monday, only a few dozen protesters remained.Law enforcement agencies had stepped up their presence across the Minneapolis area after Sunday night violence. The number of Minnesota National Guard troops was expected to more than double to over 1,000 by Monday night.Authorities earlier Monday released body camera footage that showed the officer shouting at Wright as police tried to arrest him.\u201cI\u2019ll Tase you! I\u2019ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!\u201d she can be heard saying. She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away and the officer is heard saying, \u201cHoly (expletive)! I shot him.\u201dBrooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting \u201cdeeply tragic\u201d and said the officer should be fired.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole,\u201d he said.Elliott later announced that the city council had voted to give his office \u201ccommand authority\u201d over the police department.This \u201cwill streamline things and establish a chain of command and leadership,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. He also said the city manager had been fired, and that the deputy city manager would take over his duties.The reason behind the firing was not immediately clear, but the city manager controls the police department, according to the city\u2019s charter. Now-former City Manager Curt Boganey, speaking earlier to reporters, declined to say whether he believed the officer should be fired and that she would get \u201cdue process\u201d after the shooting.Brooklyn Center is a modest suburb just north of Minneapolis that has seen its demographics shift dramatically in recent years. In 2000, more than 70% of the city was white. Today, a majority of residents are Black, Asian or Latino.Elliott, the city\u2019s first Black mayor, immigrated from Liberia as a child. On Monday night, he was joined by Keith Ellison, the state\u2019s first Black attorney general, in addressing a group of protesters not far from the police department \u2014 telling the demonstrators to use their voices but remain safe.\u201cWe are going to get to the bottom of this, we are going to make sure that there\u2019s justice, that there\u2019s officers held accountable,\u201d Elliott can be heard telling protesters on video posted by a reporter for Minneapolis television station KARE.Ellison reminded the crowd he currently is leading the prosecution of the the first officer charged in Floyd\u2019s death, and promised Wright\u2019s death will not be \u201cswept under the rug.\u201dThe body camera footage showed three officers around a stopped car, which authorities said was pulled over because it had expired registration tags. When another officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a second officer tells him he\u2019s being arrested on a warrant. That\u2019s when the struggle begins, followed by the shooting. Then the car travels several blocks before striking another vehicle.Gannon said he believed the officer had intended to use her Taser, but instead fired one bullet at Wright. From \u201cwhat I viewed and the officer\u2019s reaction in distress immediately after that this was an accidental discharge that resulted in the tragic death of Mr. Wright.\u201dWright died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s office said in a statement.The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the shooting, identified the officer as Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran who has been placed on administrative leave.Gannon would not say whether she would be fired.\u201cI think we can watch the video and ascertain whether she will be returning,\u201d the chief said.Court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.Wright\u2019s mother, Katie Wright, said her son called her as he was getting pulled over.During the call, she said she heard scuffling and then someone saying \u201cDaunte, don\u2019t run\u201d before the call ended. When she called back, her son\u2019s girlfriend answered and said he had been shot.His brother, Dallas Bryant, told about a hundred people gathered for a candlelight vigil Monday evening that Wright sounded scared during the phone call, and questioned how the officer could mistake a gun for a Taser.\u201cYou know the difference between plastic and metal. We all know it,\u201d he said.Demonstrators began to gather shortly after the shooting, with some jumping atop police cars. Marchers also descended on the city\u2019s police headquarters, throwing rocks and other objects. About 20 businesses were broken into at the city\u2019s Shingle Creek shopping center, authorities said.The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer charged in Floyd\u2019s death, continued Monday. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck. Prosecutors say Floyd was pinned for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. The judge in that case refused Monday to sequester the jury after a defense attorney argued that the panel could be influenced by the prospect of what might happen as a result of their verdict.___Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Aaron Morrison in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Jonathan Lemire in Washington contributed to this report.___Mohamed Ibrahim is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
