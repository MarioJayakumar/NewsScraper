(WKYT) - The Holloway family\u2019s first brush with royalty started when Prince Philip traveled to Lexington for the 1978 Three-Day World Eventing Championships.\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was going to have any impact on our family,\u201d Holloway said.Blaine Holloway\u2019s father, Dr. James. B Holloway, was president of Equestrian Events, Inc., the event\u2019s host. Holloway said his mother, Catherine Holloway, also played a role in planning and executing the event.It was at the event venue, the then brand new Kentucky Horse Park, where Dr. Holloway and the Duke of Edinburgh would become friends. Holloway said the late royal consort wanted to return to Kentucky after the event was over.\u201cHe came up with the idea of coming back to check out the horse farms for the queen,\u201d he said.Elizabeth Playforth, Holloway\u2019s sister, said it was important to Prince Philip that he be treated as a private person on the trip.\u201cHe told them, \u2018I don\u2019t want any press, I don\u2019t want any pictures,\u2019 and my parents absolutely did that,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of their friends knew he was coming.\u201dThe Holloways welcomed the prince to their home at Caveland Farm in Clark County. While the prince was there, he visited Gainesway, Spendthrift and Claiborne Farms.Once they got past the royal protocols, Holloway and Playforth said the prince was a disarming man, a history buff and committed to his duty to his country and his wife.\u201cHe was so gracious and so kind and so soft-spoken, but he had his opinions and he knew what he wanted to do and how to do it,\u201d Playforth said.Holloway said the duke talked to him about his interests, including horses and hunting. He said the duke remembered the family enjoyed fox hunting, and invited them to a 22 day trip across the pond, where they stayed at private estates.\u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 he said. \u201cThey were big, palatial estates, they were all friends of Prince Philip\u2019s. We would arrive, they would have a dinner party for us.\u201dAt the end of the trip, they traveled to London and stayed at Buckingham Palace. A couple of years following that, Dr. and Mrs. Holloway were invited to a visit at Windsor Castle. Holloway still has a memento from that trip, a menu card that was placed at his mother\u2019s seat.Today, he and his sister watched a service memorializing a man living for nearly 100 years of history.\u201cBecause of COVID-19, he got to have the funeral he really wanted,\u201d Playforth said. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of the man he was. I don\u2019t think he was for a lot of show.\u201dHolloway said he admires the prince for giving up his career for the woman he loved.\u201cI don\u2019t think staying two steps behind his whole life would\u2019ve been easy and I think he did it with great courage,\u201c he said. \u201cHe had a good sense of humor. I think he was just a man of that generation.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/18/he-was-so-gracious-lexington-siblings-remember-visits-with-late-prince-philip/", "date": "Published: Apr. 17, 2021 at 9:33 PM EDT"}
