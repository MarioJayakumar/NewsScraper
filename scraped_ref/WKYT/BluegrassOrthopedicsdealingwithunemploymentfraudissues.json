(WKYT) - Like a lot of businesses we\u2019ve heard from, Bluegrass Orthopedics has received several fraudulent unemployment claims. They say at this point, they\u2019ve done everything they can to notify the state about that fraud.Bluegrass Orthopedics received notice of unemployment claims for three employees, but no one had been laid off.\u201cTowards the end of March. I got a letter in the mail and it said something about I qualified for employment insurance. And I was like gee I wonder what this is. Because I\u2019ve never filed for unemployment,\u201d Sandra Chowning said.This weekend, Chowning got a check, and a notice another check had been re-deposited.\u201cI think the alarming thing was that it said this check had been re-deposited. So she knows there\u2019s money out there. It didn\u2019t come to her so it\u2019s going to somebody,\u201d said Laura Otte with Bluegrass Orthopedics.Both women said they tried multiple times, over several weeks, to reach someone in the unemployment office, but didn\u2019t have any luck.\u201cI contacted channel 27 because I knew you all had done a story previously on the fraudulent claims and you all responded immediately. And really all I want is a message out there for people how to notify the state, what to do to protect yourself,\u201d Otte said.Finally, they called the governor\u2019s office and made a little headway. A woman in his office told them Chowning should file a police report and contact the IRS. But that\u2019s the only office they\u2019ve heard from.\u201cAt least 25 times during a period of two weeks tried to notify the state to the point where emails were sent, faxes were sent, you cannot leave a voicemail. There\u2019s no portal for employers to go to to indicate that fraud has happened,\u201d Otte said.\u201cIt\u2019s really scary. I mean I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be held liable because it seems like people who need unemployment can\u2019t get it, and then they\u2019re handing out these checks to all these fraudulent claims,\u201d Chowning said.The unemployment website is set to reopen Tuesday. People who have filed legitimate claims will not need to refile them, however they will have to re-register their account with the increased security measures.For people who have filed legitimate unemployment claims, the government has a list of steps they\u2019ll need to take to secure their account once it\u2019s back online. It includes creating a new 12-character password to try to prevent the scammers from gaining access.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/12/bluegrass-orthopedics-dealing-with-unemployment-fraud-issues/", "date": "Published: Apr. 12, 2021 at 6:15 PM EDT"}
