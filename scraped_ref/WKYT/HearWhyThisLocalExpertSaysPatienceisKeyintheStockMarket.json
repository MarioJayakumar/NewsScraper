{"title": "Hear Why This Local Expert Says Patience is Key in the Stock Market", "body": "I\u2019ve been in this game now for over 20 years. In reality, that\u2019s nothing compared to the more than 200 years we\u2019ve been exchanging stock ownership in this country. That being said, I\u2019ve been around enough to know how these cycles work. Spoiler alert, if you\u2019d rather be surprised by the market storyline you may want to stop reading now. For those that don\u2019t mind skipping ahead a bit and looking out into the future, please read on.First, let us set the stage. The market is expensive. While that\u2019s a loaded term thrown around by finance academics to insinuate some sort of value, let\u2019s keep it real. Think for a moment about a gallon of milk. At our Kroger I typically buy a gallon for $2.49. Let\u2019s assume one day I venture over to grab my gallon and the price is $4.25. This isn\u2019t 10 years in the future, this is next Tuesday. Needless to say, we\u2019d probably be drinking water for a few weeks. Basically, that\u2019s where the market is at this very moment.Money is flowing like water with the government issuing stimulus checks to most Americans and proposing billions if not trillions more. Many of these funds are flowing right into new trading accounts bidding up stocks.Combine this with a new-found love and appreciation for the stock market and its easy riches, and we have the recipe for massive speculation. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve heard from more folks I haven\u2019t chatted with in months, if not years, to discuss the markets. The same vehicle that has been around for over 200 years is now more popular than ever.Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t see a new market savant in my social media stream letting me know just how easy this game of \u2018stonks\u2019 is (in case you didn\u2019t know, they\u2019ve actually given stocks this new pet name).How about real estate? Ha! If you thought stocks were on the rise, this is nothing compared to home prices and the accompanying flood of new speculators, investors and flippers. I keep asking my bride if she doesn\u2019t mind selling our home and moving into an RV for a few years. It\u2019s falling on deaf ears. I can name at least 20 people that are venturing into real estate for the first time as investors at these levels. THESE LEVELS!Heck, even collectibles are through the roof, with baseball cards taking center stage. If you have any old memorabilia from your youth you\u2019ve been holding onto, you may want to dig it out and see what\u2019s going on in that market. It\u2019s beyond nuts and maybe it pays for your next vacation or even a few mortgage payments!Now, is this surprising? Well, it shouldn\u2019t be. For those that attended our inflation webinar you know that asset price increase is ingredient #2 for the inflationary freight train and to say we\u2019re seeing that now is an understatement.But how does this all play out? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked.First off, we\u2019re in the early stages of the inflationary super-cycle I believe we\u2019ll be seeing over the next 10 years. This does not, however, mean we won\u2019t have pullbacks or corrections along the way, which I believe is inevitable and will serve to shake things up and embolden those who stay along for the ride.At this very moment I believe the stove is as hot as I\u2019ve seen it in a very long time, and I believe one of those corrections is around the bend. If you\u2019ve been driving 90, maybe consider taking your foot off the gas a bit just to be safe. In market terms, that means revisiting your allocation, making sure you\u2019re not overly aggressive and can handle pullbacks without losing sleep or making irrational decisions.On the other hand, if you\u2019ve been waiting and watching, be careful not to chase stocks. If there\u2019s one recipe for disaster that I\u2019ve seen over the years, it\u2019s buying that gallon of milk thinking they just won\u2019t make any more. It won\u2019t kill you to drink water for a few weeks waiting for the next batch, FOMO, or fear of missing out, is \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 one of the worst investment strategies in the world.In our firm, we\u2019re still positioned relatively conservatively and after buying into the most recent pullback, we\u2019re still waiting for opportunities. They will come, and when they do, we will be looking to capitalize on them while others are being shaken out. We don\u2019t chase stocks and never will.The name of the game at this stage is patience. Patience to wait for proper entries, patience to avoid the hype and patience to let the market work to your advantage.To learn more, lease visit .", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/sponsored/joule-financial/hear-why-this-local-expert-says-patience-is-key-stock-market/", "date": ""}
