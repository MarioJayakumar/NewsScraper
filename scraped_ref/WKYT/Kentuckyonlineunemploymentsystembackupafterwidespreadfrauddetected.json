(WKYT) - Kentucky\u2019s online unemployment system is back up after being shut down for several days.The state closed the portal because of widespread fraud in the system.As the system reopens, many Kentuckians are still having trouble.Kentucky labor officials have spent the weekend making security upgrades to the online unemployment system, the key thing is that people wanting to file claims are going to have to have a new eight-digit pin instead of a four-digit one.Labor officials say the problem is that criminals have been able to get into the system because some pins were as simple as 1-1-1-1 or 20-20.That task is daunting though because the call center that reopened Tuesday aims to help 300,000 people reset their pins.Daniel Martinez is still trying to get his unemployment claim resolved months after losing his job. For several days, he hasn\u2019t been able to do anything because the unemployment portal was shut down because of fraud.But, on Tuesday, when he was supposed to call to get a new PIN, he\u2019s having the same problem as when he first applied: no one answers the phone.\u201cCrossing my fingers that everything works out,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe new portal pin, that\u2019s supposed to come in the mail right? It hasn\u2019t come yet. What if I don\u2019t get it and I can\u2019t get into the system.\u201dWhat\u2019s worse is that while Martinez can\u2019t get unemployment, his mother is being told she can and she didn\u2019t even apply!He believes the letter his mother received was fraudulent and that\u2019s the reason the entire system was shut down in the first place. It\u2019s all just one big mess he can\u2019t seem to get any relief from.\u201cBecause it is like zero communication from them. I don\u2019t get what is the big deal,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhy is it so hard to communicate with them?\u201dWe also heard from one woman today who said she called the number Tuesday morning only to be told in a recording that her new pin was going to be mailed to her. But labor officials say they hope the new eight-digit pin will be too long or complicated for cybercriminals.In-person help through new career centers starts Thursday. One of the people we talked to today said she has was finally able to get one of those appointments next week.State officials say the call center that reopened is only for resetting pins and cannot be used to ask any other questions.We also reached out to state Labor Cabinet officials for a status update on the online portal, but we could not get through either.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/13/kentucky-online-unemployment-system-back-up-after-widespread-fraud-detected/", "date": "Published: Apr. 13, 2021 at 11:24 AM EDT"}
