{"title": "The queen says goodbye to Philip, continues her reign alone ", "body": "WINDSOR, England (AP) \u2014 Sitting by herself at the funeral of Prince Philip on Saturday, Queen Elizabeth cut a regal but solitary figure: still the monarch, but now alone.The queen sat apart from family members at the simple but somber ceremony in accordance with strict social distancing rules during the coronavirus pandemic. But if the ceremony had been for anyone else, at her side would have been her husband of 73 years, who gave a lifetime of service to the crown.Wearing a facemask, the queen was dressed all in black, except for the diamond brooch that flashed on her left shoulder \u2014 a piece she had often worn on engagements with her husband.The monarch\u2019s four children and eight grandchildren sat in small groups nearby, during a stripped-back service at Windsor Castle that made their loss somehow more personal for people who often live their lives in public. The pandemic has put Britain\u2019s royal family in the same position as many others, unable to give loved ones the sendoffs they would have wanted.Just 30 mourners were allowed to attend the service for the prince, who died April 9 at the age of 99.\u201cWe have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,\u201d the dean of Windsor, David Conner, said in his call to prayer. \u201cOur lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us; the encouragement that he has given us; his kindness, humor and humanity.\u201dPhilip\u2019s body was carried to St. George\u2019s Chapel at the castle on a Land Rover that the prince himself had specially designed. It was followed by members of the Royal Family, including Princes William and Harry, who made their first public appearance together since Harry and his wife, Meghan, gave a controversial interview to U.S. television host Oprah Winfrey in which they discussed the difficulties of royal life and how the two brothers had grown apart.The procession traversed the grounds of Windsor Castle, passing military detachments arrayed under bright blue skies.The nation honored Philip with a minute\u2019s silence observed across the United Kingdom at 3 p.m., its beginning and end marked by a gun fired by the King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery. The final shot signaled the start of a funeral service steeped in military and royal tradition, but infused with the duke\u2019s personality.Inside the medieval Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, this service was quiet and without excessive pageantry. Philip was deeply involved in planning the ceremony. At his request, there was no sermon. There were also no eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition.Former Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who knew Philip well, said the 50-minute service reflected the preferences of the prince, who was a man of faith but liked things to be succinct.\u201cHe was at home with broad church, high church and low church, but what he really liked was short church,\u201d Chartres told the BBC.The monarch offered her own touches to the day. Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual, unposed photo was a favorite of the queen.Earlier in the day, a few local residents left flowers outside the castle, though most people heeded requests from the palace and police to stay away because of the pandemic.The funeral procession and the service itself took place out of public view, within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (about 30 kilometers) west of London. It was broadcast live on television.The day\u2019s events began at 11 a.m., when Philip\u2019s coffin was moved from the royal family\u2019s private chapel to the Inner Hall of Windsor Castle, where it rested until the procession began. The coffin was draped with Philip\u2019s personal standard, topped with his Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword. The sword was given to him by his father-in-law, King George VI, on the occasion of his marriage to the queen in 1947.Composing a wreath atop the coffin were flowers chosen by the queen, including white lilies, small white roses, white freesia, white wax flower, white sweet peas and jasmine. A note from the monarch was attached, but its contents were not disclosed.The funeral reflected Philip\u2019s military ties, both as the ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of the Royal Navy who served with distinction during World War II. More than 700 military personnel took part in the commemorative events, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.The armed forces also sent wreaths of flowers that were laid outside St. George\u2019s chapel, some with handwritten notes. One said the Royal Marines wanted to pay their respects to a man \u201cwho stood with us and among us for 64 years.\u201dLieutenant Gen. Roland Walker, regimental lieutenant colonel of the Grenadier Guards, said his unit was honored to take part because of its close relationship with the prince. Philip served as regimental colonel of the guards, its honorary leader, for 42 years.\u201cThis is a privilege,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cBecause my understanding is he planned this, so we\u2019re here because he wanted us to be here, and that, I think, down to the junior guardsmen, is a known fact.\u2019'Philip and the queen\u2019s children \u2014 Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward \u2014 walked behind the hearse along with other members of the Royal Family, all of whom wore civilian clothes at the queen\u2019s request. The queen followed in a Bentley.William and Harry were part of the nine-member royal contingent, although their cousin, Peter Phillips, walked between them. There was no obvious tension between the brothers, whose relationship has been strained since Harry\u2019s decision to quit royal duties and move to California. After the service, they walked back to the castle together, seeming to chat amiably.Their appearance at the service stirred memories of the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana, when William and Harry, then 15 and 12, walked behind their mother\u2019s coffin accompanied by Philip.In honor of Philip\u2019s military service, several elements of the funeral had a maritime theme, including the hymn \u201cEternal Father, Strong to Save,\u201d which is associated with seafarers and seeks protection \u201cfor those in peril on the sea.\u201dAs Philip\u2019s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded \u201cAction Stations,\u201d an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle \u2014 included in the service at Philip\u2019s request. He will rest there, at least until the queen\u2019s death, alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including King George III, whose reign included the years of the American Revolution. The queen and Philip are expected to be buried together in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife\u2019s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.\u201cTo be perfectly honest I didn\u2019t realize the extent (of) what his life had been, what he had done for us all,\u201d said Viv Davies, who came to pay her respects in Windsor. \u201cHe was a marvelous husband, wasn\u2019t he, to the queen and the children? Just remarkable \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we will see the like again.\u201d___Jill Lawless reported from London.___Follow AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of Prince Philip at ", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/17/funeral-to-praise-philips-courage-and-support-for-queen/", "date": "Published: Apr. 17, 2021 at 2:43 AM EDT"}
