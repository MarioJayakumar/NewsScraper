(WKYT) - Whether you\u2019re a bookworm or not, many of us agree reading is an important part of child development.In a year filled with screen time and virtual classes, students smiled, waved, and waited in anticipation for a good old-fashioned book.\u201cI think it\u2019s just a connection made with books when it\u2019s physically in your hand and then you have that book for as long as you choose to keep it, so I think it\u2019s special,\u201d says Fayette County Education Association president Jessica Hiler.Hiler explains this year\u2019s \u201cRead Across America.\u201d It\u2019s a drive-through event for kids up to grad 5 to pick up a free book and goodie bag. Plus, some of our favorite characters made appearances.\u201cAs a retired pre-k teacher, reading is really important,\u201d says Hollianne Hash.Hash grabbed books for three of her grandkids and says they waited for the event with anticipation.\u201cOhh yes, very excited especially Handan the third-grader, he was major excited,\u201d Hash says. \u201cIt shows that it matters. It shows that a bunch of adults got up early probably and out of maybe even their comfort zone to help the children have something good to do.\u201dWhile this school year\u2019s been different, to many educators, it\u2019s about celebrating students\u2019 accomplishments despite the obstacles.\u201cWe just want to celebrate our public schools, we want to celebrate our kids and our teachers and all the hard work they do, and just have a good time today,\u201d Hiler says.In a \u201cnormal\u201d year, the event takes place at the Fayette Mall. Typically, 1,000 to 1,500 free books are given away.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/17/read-across-america-hopes-to-inspire-children-in-fayette-co-to-read/", "date": "Published: Apr. 17, 2021 at 1:07 PM EDT"}
