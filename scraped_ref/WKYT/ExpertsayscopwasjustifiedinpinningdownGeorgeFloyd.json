{"title": "Expert says cop was justified in pinning down George Floyd ", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Former Officer  was justified in pinning  to the ground because he kept struggling, a use-of-force expert testified for the defense Tuesday, contradicting a parade of authorities from both inside and outside the Minneapolis Police Department.Taking the stand at Chauvin\u2019s murder trial, Barry Brodd, a former Santa Rosa, California, officer, stoutly defended Chauvin\u2019s actions, even as a prosecutor pounded away at the witness during cross-examination and banged on the lectern. At one point, the prosecutor reacted mockingly when Brodd said that Floyd kept moving instead of \u201cresting comfortably\u201d on the pavement.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to sit and judge ... an officer\u2019s conduct,\u201d Brodd testified. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a challenge to, again, put yourself in the officer\u2019s shoes to try to make an evaluation through what they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination.\u201dHe said he doesn\u2019t believe Chauvin and the other officers used deadly force when they held Floyd down on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind his back and Chauvin\u2019s knee on his neck or neck area for what prosecutors say was 9 1/2 minutes.Brodd likened it instead to a situation in which officers use a Taser on someone fighting with officers, and the suspect falls, hits his head and dies: \u201cThat isn\u2019t an incident of deadly force. That\u2019s an incident of an accidental death.\u201dSeveral top Minneapolis police officials, including the police chief, have testified that Chauvin used excessive force and violated his training. And medical experts called by prosecutors have said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because of the way he was restrained.But Brodd said: \u201cI felt that Officer Chauvin\u2019s interactions with Mr. Floyd were following his training, following current practices in policing and were objectively reasonable.\u201dThe question of  is important: Police officers are allowed certain latitude to use deadly force when someone puts the officer or other people in danger. Legal experts say a key issue for the jury will be whether Chauvin\u2019s actions were reasonable in those specific circumstances.Prosecutor Steve Schleicher used his cross-examination to once again painstakingly go through video clips of a pinned-down Floyd gasping that he couldn\u2019t breathe and then going limp.The prosecutor hammered away at Brodd, saying that a reasonable officer in Chauvin\u2019s position would have known Floyd stopped resisting, that another officer told him he couldn\u2019t find a pulse, and that others said Floyd had passed out and was no longer breathing.\u201cAnd the defendant\u2019s position is, and was, and remains, as we see here at this moment, in this time, in this clip -- on top of Mr. Floyd on the street. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Schleicher asked, as he banged his hand on the podium repeatedly.\u201cYes,\u201d Brodd replied.At one point, Brodd argued that Floyd kept on struggling instead of just \u201cresting comfortably\u201d on the ground.\u201cDid you say \u2018resting comfortably\u2019?\u201d an incredulous Schleicher asked.Brodd: \u201cOr laying comfortably.\u201dSchleicher: \u201cResting comfortably on the pavement?\u201dBrodd: \u201cYes.\u201dThe prosecutor went on to say that Floyd was moving, but it was because he was struggling to breathe by shoving his shoulder into the pavement.Under questioning by the defense, Brodd also testified that bystanders yelling at police to get off Floyd complicated the situation for Chauvin and the others by causing them to wonder whether the crowd was becoming a threat, too.Brodd also appeared to endorse what prosecution witnesses have said is a common misconception: that if someone can talk, he or she can breathe.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t have medical degrees, but I was always trained and feel it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that if somebody\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m choking, I\u2019m choking,\u2019 well, you\u2019re not choking because you can breathe,\u201d he said.Chauvin, a 45-year-old white man, is on trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death last May after his arrest of suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market.Chauvin attorney has argued that the 19-year Minneapolis police veteran did what he was trained to do and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were discovered in his system.The defense began presenting its case on Tuesday after the prosecution rested following 11 days of testimony and a mountain of video evidence.Nelson started by bringing up a 2019 arrest in which Floyd suffered from dangerously high blood pressure and confessed to heavy use of opioids. And he suggested that the 46-year-old Black man may have suffered last May from  \u2014 what a witness described as a potentially lethal state of agitation and even superhuman strength that can be triggered by drugs, heart disease or mental problems.Nelson also elicited testimony from another witness that Floyd panicked and cried over and over, \u201cPlease, please, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d when officers first approached his SUV at gunpoint on the day of his death.Nicole Mackenzie, a Minneapolis police training officer, was called by Nelson to expound on . While Floyd was pinned to the ground, a relatively new officer at the scene had mentioned that Floyd might be suffering from such a condition.Mackenzie testified that the signs of excited delirium can include incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and sweating, and that officers are trained to call paramedics, because a person in that state can rapidly go into cardiac arrest.An expert in forensic medicine previously dismissed Nelson\u2019s excited-delirium suggestion during the prosecution\u2019s case, saying Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians.The defense\u2019s first witnesses testified about a May 6, 2019, incident in which Floyd was pulled from a car and arrested by Minneapolis police.A now-retired paramedic who responded to that call, Michelle Moseng, testified that Floyd told her he had been taking multiple opioids about every 20 minutes.\u201cI asked him why and he said it was because he was addicted,\u201d said Moseng, who described Floyd\u2019s behavior as \u201celevated and agitated\u201d before the judge struck that remark from the record.Moseng said she recommended taking Floyd to the hospital based on his high blood pressure, which she measured at 216 over 160.On cross-examination, prosecutor Erin Eldridge got Moseng to testify that Floyd\u2019s respiratory output, pulse, heart rate, EKG and heart rhythms were normal. Eldridge said Floyd was taken to the hospital and released two hours later.The prosecution\u2019s expert witnesses rejected the notion that drugs or underlying health problems caused Floyd\u2019s death, with a cardiology expert on Monday saying that Floyd appeared to have \u201can exceptionally strong heart.\u201dAnother defense witness Tuesday was Shawanda Hill, who was in the SUV with Floyd before his ill-fated encounter with Chauvin.When he saw an officer at the window with a gun, Floyd \u201cinstantly grabbed the wheel and he was like, \u2018Please, please, don\u2019t kill me. Please, please, don\u2019t shoot me. Don\u2019t shoot me. What did I do? Just tell me what I did,\u2019\u201d Hill testified.Also testifying was Minneapolis Park Police Officer Peter Chang, who helped at the scene that day. He said he saw a \u201ccrowd\u201d growing across the street that \u201cwas becoming more loud and aggressive, a lot of yelling across the street.\u201d\u201cDid that cause you any concern?\u201d Nelson asked.\u201cConcern for the officers\u2019 safety, yes,\u201d Chang replied.Nelson hasn\u2019t said whether Chauvin  Testifying could open him up to devastating cross-examination but could also give the jury the opportunity to see any remorse or sympathy he might feel.___Find AP\u2019s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: ___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.
