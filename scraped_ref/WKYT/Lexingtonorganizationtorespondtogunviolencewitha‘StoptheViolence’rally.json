(WKYT) - We\u2019re coming off So far we\u2019ve seen five deadly shootings in the month of April, and a total of 15 in 2021.One organization in Lexington is saying enough is enough, and responding with a rally Tuesday evening.For Sherry Warsh, one life lost to gun violence is one life too many.\u201cI\u2019m tired of losing our young people, we\u2019re losing a generation,\u201d Warsh says.Warsh has multiple cousins whose children and grandchildren have been killed. Now, she\u2019s part of a group called \u201cBUILD.\u201d It addresses issues of poverty and injustice in the Lexington area.Tuesday evening they\u2019re hosting a \u201cStop the Violence\u201d rally at Shiloh Baptist Church. At least 10 hearses will be lined up throughout the street as part of a symbolic funeral procession. Those involved say it\u2019s about accountability and awareness to ongoing gun violence.Warsh is asking for city officials to try new programs to show young people alternative lifestyles.\u201cNo one entity can bring a resolution and solve this by themselves. Community, police, all city officials, we have to and we must work together,\u201d says Shiloh Baptist pastor Joseph Owens.Owens says everyone in the community has a moral obligation to help.\u201cI feel we have become a little bit complacent. We see one shooting after another but because these shootings are spaced out, we don\u2019t get the full picture,\u201d Owens says.To Warsh, it\u2019s about keeping just one parent from burring a child.\u201cWe\u2019re called to be our brother\u2019s keeper and we\u2019re called to help each other, so if you\u2019re sitting back and going well it doesn\u2019t affect me that\u2019s wrong because it does,\u201d Warsh says.The rally will start at 6 p.m. on Tuesday. The procession is leaving at around 6:40 p.m. Everyone is welcome.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/19/lexington-organization-to-respond-to-gun-violence-with-a-stop-the-violence-rally/", "date": "Published: Apr. 19, 2021 at 4:31 PM EDT"}
