(WAVE) - After a double lung transplant, a Louisville man is crediting the process for saving his life after he got COVID-19.Speaking to WAVE 3 News, Mike Olsen said he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2014 and required a lung transplant five years later; he received the organ from an anonymous donor.\u201cI was so curious as to who would have died, who have signed an organ donor card so I could live? I was so grateful,\u201d he said.Olsen told WAVE 3 News the transplant gave him a second chance at life, but he knew he would have a weakened immune system and was susceptible to infection after surgery.\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a mask for seven years,\u201d he joked. \u201cWe were always careful pre-transplant as well as post-transplant.\u201dOlsen increased his precautious with COVID-19; he feared the respiratory virus could wreak havoc on his body. He said he was \u201cfloored\u201d in January when he tested positive.\u201cI was not only I floored, I was feeling awful like a MAC truck had hit me four times. In fact, my oxygen saturation was going down just like it was before transplant,\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking at the monitor like, \u2018I am in trouble.\u201dOlsen said he was afraid to go to the hospital; he thought if he were put on a ventilator he wouldn\u2019t survive.However, Olsen discovered through seeking treatment his lungs were strong enough for him to heal outside the hospital. He said he received the BAM antibody infusion, an oral antibiotic, and recovered at home.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have this lung transplant, and I had my old dying IPF lungs, I would\u2019ve been dead for sure. I don\u2019t know what was in [the donor\u2019s] DNA or what was going on, but these lungs are like power lungs to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really did a battle for me during COVID and really got me through the other side.\u201dOlsen believes his new lungs saved his life a second time; he hopes to pay it forward by donating his organs in the future.\u201cI was on a lot of medications, so I thought I couldn\u2019t donate \u2026 but they said, no you can, you can donate your eyes, tissue, other things can be donated,\u201d he said.Speaking to WAVE 3, Shelly Snyder with Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates (KODA) explained there are thousands of people currently on the state\u2019s organ waitlist.\u201cTragically, every day, 20 people lose their life because an organ was not made available for them,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of us can do a little something about it by registering.\u201dIn April, people are encouraged to register as organ donors as part of National Donate Life Month.Anyone 18 and older can register as an organ donor when renewing their driver\u2019s license, online onor by updated the \u201cHealth\u201d app on their smartphone.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/17/kentucky-man-credits-lung-transplant-with-saving-his-life-after-contracting-covid/", "date": "Published: Apr. 16, 2021 at 9:42 PM EDT"}
