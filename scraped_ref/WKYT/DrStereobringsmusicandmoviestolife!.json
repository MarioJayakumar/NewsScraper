Our hope is that you will have a new-found love of music and movies by choosing .Dr. Stereo can also help you create the ideal sound system for your particular space. Here are a few of the most common questions we receive when working with people to create their personal sound systems.There are many considerations when choosing speakers for your space. Room size and layout are very important when we design a sound system. We are selling and installing many Dolby Atmos and DTS:X systems, which means that there are 8 discreet channels of information--7 of them are full band width and 1 channel for the subwoofer. You\u2019ll need an amplifier (receiver) that decodes the information properly. We also sell two-channel audio systems if you don\u2019t need a full surround system. Or perhaps you\u2019re building a new home and you\u2019re looking for a dedicated home theater room in your basement. We can set up a 9.1.6 immersive AV receiver that will do Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, IMAX Enhanced Auro-3D, Dolby Vision and Dirac Live.It is best for one of our staff to come out to look at your space. Every single person or business has unique needs and totally different spaces. We offer free consultations in our Central Kentucky region. We find out what your goals are and what your budget is. You can\u2019t buy a new car with $500, so the same applies to sound systems--it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all concept. We ask our clients will be using the equipment,  people will be in the space, how loud will the people be, etc. If it\u2019s a pool party and there are kids around, you\u2019ll want to hear the music above the splashing! Our showroom is available, by appointment only, to assist in final selection of the equipment you\u2019ll need when listening to music, watching movies, gaming, and of course, watching sports.The basic components you\u2019ll need to get a nice outdoor system are an amplifier, a source, some speakers, and speaker wire. Our labor is based on the scope of your project. What kind of source, you may ask? Streaming devices like Yamaha\u2019s MusicCast system or MainStream Audio\u2019s iEast, AM/FM tuner, TV, or even the old school CD Player! Our speakers are all-weather and come with manufacturers\u2019 warranties so you can leave them out in ALL of the elements. You\u2019ll want a bright, vivid picture on any outdoor TV you choose, and we go over placement of the equipment when we do in-home consultations.Bluetooth transmission does not always have reliable results. Wired speakers are going to be your most reliable and best sounding solution. We prefer Wifi over bluetooth systems, but if Wifi is spotty or not available, we can use a bluetooth application. Wifi has better bandwidth and usually better distance, whereas bluetooth is limited on sound quality and on range.Contact us at 859-314-4436", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/sponsored/dr-stereo/dr-stereo-brings-you-outdoor-movie-magic/", "date": ""}
