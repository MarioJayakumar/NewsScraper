A husband and wife took their love for coffee and turned an old school bus into their very own mobile coffee shop.\u201cIt really started out as a joke and then we started researching and learning about it and just evolving this whole idea,\u201d said Sara Bradford, owner.Tin Roof Coffee also has unique flavors, like the Harry Potter-inspired Butterbeer, and Double Chocolate Cookies and Cream. All thanks to the sweet tooth of the owner.\u201cIt started with just like a handful of flavors that every day I would get more ideas and more ideas. So that\u2019s probably my fault with my sweet tooth,\u201d Bradford added.The Bradfords added they were overwhelmed by the community support for their opening day Tuesday morning.\u201cWe got a message that said \u2018I don\u2019t know what you put in this coffee\u2019 and I panicked. I am like \u2018oh my gosh what does it say?\u2019 The rest of it said \u2018I need all of it I need more.\u2019 It makes you feel like all the blood, sweat, and tears is all worth it. I mean I have cried we both have,\u201d said Bradford.If you are interested Tin Roof coffee will roll up to your business just message them on social media their handle is @tinroofcoffee_. You can also follow them to see where they will be parking their coffee shop next.", "url": "https://www.wkyt.com/2021/04/14/bowling-green-couple-turns-old-school-bus-into-mobile-coffee-shop/", "date": "Published: Apr. 13, 2021 at 7:16 PM EDT"}
